In the house
-- Does it have solar? - This can increase home price. Don't agree to paying full solar cost because owners would have gotten federal incentive
-- How old is it? 
--|---- Even 10 years old mean that roof may need repair and it'll come to you
--|---- Anything before 1980 can have lead
--|---- Anything before 1990 can have asbestos
--|---- Anything before 2000 is very likely to not be energy efficient
-- What appliances are included?
-- Is it townhouse or single family?
--|---- Maybe towhouses will have less privacy because wall is shared, and generally the bedrooms are made along the shared wall. This issue may not be felt when living in condo/apartment because they generally do 4 on a level, and each unit's bedroom(s) are farthest from others' bedrooms


Is it new build?
-- What are seller's incentives?
--|---- Is low interest rate an incentive? But if the market-wide mortgage rate lowers in future, then the usefulness of this incentive is gone. So, is it likely that rates will reduce? Can the buyer instead reduce price or pay cover closing cost?
-- Is new build from builder who constructed other houses that are also for sale? Then the builder of new build is competing against themselves? This can help in negotiating price of new build


HOA
-- What are the HOA covenants
-- Is trash removal included?
-- If going to area with snow, is snow removal included?
-- How are the reviews of the HOA management company


From google maps
-- school locations (can be seen in Redfin and Zillow)
-- Fire station locations
-- Hospital and urgent care locations
-- grocery locations (Walmart, Sam's club, Costco, Whole foods, any local stores)
-- Is the house in outskirts with no close by facilities?
-- Is the house close to major roads (then it can be noisy)
-- Are there trails / grain spaces around the house
-- Street view: does the house have good views?


From Redfin
-- Zoning code of house
-- Is water coming from Public/municipal, or water district, or anything else
-- Risk factor for house (reconfirms the values obtained from FEMA)
