GENERALLY ABOUT CLOSING:

* Another reference: https://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home/close/#services


* You’ll need to confirm your closing date and location with your lender, real estate agent, and closing agent.
-- Your real estate agent will help answer your questions and work to resolve any remaining issues with the home.
-- Depending on where you live, your closing agent may be a title company, attorney, escrow company, or lender, and they will ensure that your documents are ready. 
-- Your lender will finalize any outstanding paperwork for your mortgage application. Your lender will also make sure the money for your mortgage closing is available and closing funds are accessible so you can close on time. 


* Closing costs include lender fees, title and settlement fees, possible legal fees (some states require a real estate attorney), real estate taxes, and homeowners insurance. Make sure to get your expected payment amounts in writing from all parties.


* eClosing: If provided by lender, then in addition to reducing paper, an eClosing makes it easier to review your documents prior to closing, which allows you to ask questions, resolve errors, and avoid delays. Completing either some or all closing documents electronically can save you time.




**BEFORE** TIME OF CLOSING:

* Expect to sign a considerable number of documents during closing. Ask if a copy can be obtained earlier for review - regardless of whether it is eClosing or not
-- For example, review the spelling of your name, loan terms (e.g., rate, term, payment), tenancy, and closing costs. Be sure to notify your lender immediately if you find any issues or your closing may be delayed while they address the problem.


* Homeowners Insurance
-- You will need to contact an insurance company or insurance agent prior to closing to secure homeowner’s insurance. Your lender will want to verify adequate insurance will be in place. Your lender will always require that you maintain at least a minimal level of coverage, but you may want to add more, depending on your needs.
-- Keep in mind that homeowners insurance policies do not usually cover the damage incurred from flooding or earthquakes (or fire? / wildfire?); those events are usually covered under separate policies. Also, some policies may require separate coverage or higher deductibles for hurricane-related damages. It’s definitely wise to ask what is specifically covered by a policy before agreeing to it. 


* Title Insurance: 
-- Before scheduling a closing date, title insurance will be ordered through a title company. This is done in order to protect you and the lender from financial losses that may be tied to the property prior to you taking ownership should the title prove to be imperfect (such as prior liens, unreleased liens, disputed wills, back taxes, and defects in the title). In other words, title insurance protects against any events or title recording errors that occurred before you own the home.


* Closing Disclosure (3 days before closing)
-- At least three days prior to closing, your lender will provide you with the Closing Disclosure, which includes your loan terms, down payment amount, projected payments, closing costs, fees (or costs to get the loan), and any other costs. Verify loan terms!
--|---- Ask questions during the process to alleviate any confusion or last minute concerns during closing.
--|---- __IMPORTANT__ : You should always feel comfortable asking questions and requesting copies of documents to read carefully. If the lender pressures you to sign or is hesitant to allow time to have the documents reviewed, they are likely hiding details of the loan. 
-- Be sure to confirm the best way to send these funds to the title company as some companies prefer that it is wired ahead of time. 


* Take Your Final Home Walk-Through
-- The final walk-through is your chance to make sure the property meets all the requirements listed in your contract.
-- Most buyers do one last walk-through of the home 24 hours before the final closing date.
-- Your real estate agent will set up a time with the home seller for you to visit the home and make sure it’s in the condition you agreed to at the time of the purchase.
-- You’ll want to confirm that the seller took care of all the repairs you discussed during the sales negotiations and that the home didn’t incur any additional damage after the home inspection.




**AT** TIME OF CLOSING - DOCUMENT LIST:

* Closing Disclosure
-- A Closing Disclosure covers all the final details of your loan, including the terms of your loan, monthly payment, and details of your closing costs. You will have received a copy of this to review at least 3 days prior to closing and another copy to sign at closing. Prior to closing you should check the Closing Disclosure against the Loan Estimate you received when you applied for the mortgage for any large discrepancies.
-- *IMPORTANT*: As example, see https://www.consumerfinance.gov/owning-a-home/closing-disclosure/


* Loan Application
-- This final version of the loan application will require your signature and date. It contains details about your income, assets, and liabilities. It should be reviewed for accuracy.


* Mortgage Note (or Promissory Note)
-- The note is the legal document that specifies your loan terms including loan amount, interest rate, and duration. It represents your commitment to pay the money back.


* Deed of Trust (aka Mortgage)
-- This is the legal document that creates the security interest in the property for the loan. It uses the house you’re buying as collateral, which means if you default on mortgage payments, the lender can foreclose on the house.


* Title
-- The title is the legal document that establishes your right to the home—technically, you don’t have full ownership until you pay 100% of the loan back.


* Property Deed
-- The property deed is a public document that shows the transfer of property ownership from the seller to you.


* Affidavits
-- Affidavits are legally binding documents that you sign to indicate that all the information you’re providing is accurate.


* Initial Escrow Disclosure
-- If you are creating an escrow account, this document is required by federal law. This disclosure accounts for financial obligations that extend beyond the loan itself, such as real estate taxes, as well as mortgage and homeowners insurance premiums.


* Transfer Tax Declaration (if applicable)
-- This form applies to property transfer taxes that may be required in some cities, counties, and states.


* Certificate of Occupancy (if newly constructed home)
-- This certification indicates that the house is in compliance with building codes, and it is suitable for occupancy.




**AT** TIME OF CLOSING - PROCESS:

* See checkist pdf - for closing on loan


* Expect to sign a considerable number of documents during closing. While you may be tempted to sign them without reading them thoroughly, it’s extremely important to understand what the documents imply and to know that each is legally binding. It’s also imperative to check for accuracy. 
-- For example, review the spelling of your name, loan terms (e.g., rate, term, payment), tenancy, and closing costs. Be sure to notify your lender immediately if you find any issues or your closing may be delayed while they address the problem.


* The Day of Closing
-- At closing, you will provide the funds to close indicated on the Closing Disclosure via wire transfer to ensure the funds are available. Once received, the lender will authorize the funds for the loan amount.
-- After signing all the necessary documents, your closing is complete.
-- The title company will then ensure your ownership interest in your new home is properly recorded and you are now the rightful homeowner.
-- NOTE: all employment and income information is verified and may continue to be verified until the day of closing. Closing day delays or postponements can occur if there is a change in DTI or employment status.


* Deed and Title
-- A deed is a physical, legal document that proves property ownership and property rights. Title gives you the right of ownership to the property. You need a deed to transfer the title from the seller to you. But how do you get the deed? That’s where your title company comes in. They run the title search to make sure the home seller has a right to sell the home and transfer ownership.
-- The title company will also check for any liens against the property (i.e., claims involving the property). If a lien (such as another mortgage on the house) exists, the seller must pay it off at settlement. If it’s good to go, then the seller will transfer the title to you at closing, and the deed will be recorded with the appropriate county office. 




**AFTER** TIME OF CLOSING:

* It’s important to check with the title company a few weeks after closing to make sure the county office officially recorded the deed. If it was not recorded, check with your lender about the deed’s status.




THINGS TO NOTE: 

* Title check: Loan processor enagages with a title company that you can select, or you can go with recommendation of lender or real estate agent. The title company will order a title search to make sure the title on the home is clear of any unexpected recordings of ownership, tax or other liens; And then reports any issues found


* Tenancy: This defines the concept of ownership. You'll have to define tenancy during close. Title indicates the legal ownership of a piece of property. Tenancy is another term used to refer to the type of ownership of the property.
-- Sole Ownership: Sole Ownership is when one individual alone holds the title to the property. This type of ownership is most often used by a single individual; however, a married individual can also choose Sole Ownership if their spouse is willing to sign a document renouncing any rights to the property. In the event of the owner’s death, legal documents should be in place that dictate the transfer of the property. 
-- Joint Tenancy: Joint Tenancy is when two or more people hold title to real estate jointly with equal rights. If one owner dies, the property will automatically transfer to the surviving owner(s) regardless of marital status. Responsibility and liability are shared between all owners equally and all transactions require agreement from all parties.
-- Tenancy in Common: Tenancy in Common occurs when two or more people own a property with equal or unequal percentages of ownership. With Tenancy in Common, each owner holds a title separately and may have different percentages of ownership. The ownership interest percentage only determines the financial ownership of the real estate. Each owner has the right to occupy and use the entire property equally.  Because each owner holds a separate title for their respective portion, an owner can sell their percentage share of the property at any time. Upon death, the property does not revert to the other owners automatically. All tenants share the liability for debts on the property. If one owner is unable to pay their liabilities, the other owners will be expected to pay. All liens on the property must be cleared for a transfer of ownership to take place. 
-- Tenants by Entirety: If the owners are legally married, they can use this form of tenancy to establish ownership. For legal purposes, the ownership in real estate assumes the couple is one person and the property cannot be subdivided. A Joint Tenant can break the tenancy any time but with Tenancy by Entirety, neither partner can transfer their half of the property at death; the property transfers to the surviving spouse with no legal action or documents needed. In the case of divorce, this type of title converts to a tenancy in common to allow one owner to transfer their respective part to whomever they wish.
-- Community Property: Community Property laws currently apply in nine states: Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. In these states, each spouse owns (or owes on) all property equally regardless of who earns or spends the money. Therefore, each spouse gets an equal division of real estate in the event of death or divorce. Depending on the state where you live, real estate acquired during a common law marriage may also be held as community property.
