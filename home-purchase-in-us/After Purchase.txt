* Keep payments updated:
-- Try keeping money for at least 1 extra mortgage payment, in addition to the upcoming one.
-- Make sure property taxes, homeowners insurance, flood/etc. extra insurance, HOA is paid off. Try keeping monet for at least 1 extra payment, in addition to the upcoming one
-- If you want to keep emergency fund, have that be in addition to the mortagage safety money (above). Don't lump it together
-- If doing home improvement, make sure you have sufficient to pay contractor + keep some extra for unforeseen expenses. See "contractor" section below for more details.


* Avoid scams
-- DO NOT refinancing too often (Churning). Only continue when there is a long term gain from doing so. Verify the gain in numbers. Shop around.
-- If you are delinquent or in foreclosure, sometimes you will be targeted by unscrupulous third parties. Some may try to have you sign the deed over to them or try to purchase the home for significantly less than what it is worth to get your equity.
-- Never pay for someone to work with your mortgage company that services your loan; there are HUD-approved counselors who provide these services free of charge.  
-- DO NOT sign any document immediately without first understanding the implications.


* Keeping really good records.
-- Keep receipts and invoices for payments, home-maintenance, home-repairs, home-improvements, permits, appraisal documentation and test/inspection results. 
-- Having documents ensures you’re prepared for warranty claims and budget concerns
-- Although it is quicker and easier to log and track these files digitally, consider having physical copies as backups to offset any risk of losing your electronic files. Keep your physical records in a fireproof locked box, safe, or filing cabinet ..protected from fire, flood, and burglary


* Keep fire extinguishers handy, and periodically check their expiration


* Keep an emergency kit
-- Clean drinking water, Non-perishable food for your family and pets
-- First aid kit (including basic medications)
-- Solar powered or hand-cranked flashlight, batteries
-- Thermal blankets, Clothing for a few days
-- List of emergency contacts
-- Cash 




HOME MAINTENANCE:

* See home maintenance checkist for seasonal interior/exterior maintenance


* Exterior maintenance
-- Maintain exterior in order to protect the interior from things like water, insects, and other unwanted pests. You may also want to regularly spray for insects or contract with a pest control company to do it for you.
-- Maybe schedule annual inspection / maintenance with a copany / technician
-- Some of the most important exterior maintenance tasks include:
--|---- Cleaning gutters and downspouts to keep them free from debris
--|---- Keeping the siding and trim clean and painted to prevent rot
--|---- Checking the seals of windows and doors to prevent drafts
--|---- Taking care of your lawn
--|---- Maintaining the safety of decks, porches, and stairs
--|---- Ensuring proper ventilation to avoid mold growth
--|---- Verifying the integrity of roof (specially in rainy, or hail-y places)


* Interior maintenance
-- Maintaining the interior of the home is important for both your safety and the integrity of the home structure.
-- This could include things like:
--|---- Replacing the furnace filter
--|---- Cleaning vents
--|---- Fixing dripping faucets and running toilets
--|---- Making sure the sump pump drains properly and the tank is pumped regularly (if you have these)
--|---- Ensuring that smoke and carbon monoxide detectors are working
--|---- Keeping appliances AND fixtures in working order. If possible, keep purchase and expected-lifetime record for each appliance, so you can be proactive when the appliance is coming close to end of life


* Energy efficiency
-- If heating / cooling costs are getting high: NOTE that cracks, gaps, or leaks, whether it be from a door jamb or a gap in a window, can make it harder to maintain a comfortable temperature and lead to increased utility bills.
-- Your refrigerator and freezer are more efficient when they’re full, so keeping them stocked can cut down on their energy usage. 
-- Since it’s usually hotter during the day and cooler in the evenings, using heat intensive appliances like a dishwasher, washing machine and dryer at night can make it easier to keep cool during the day. Unless you're in winter, then use them at day
-- Maybe see if you can monitor electricity usage in all elecricity ports to identify what is consuming most electricity. This can also help identify if an appliance is getting old, because its usage will increase




HOME IMPROVEMENTS:

* Before making a large repair or renovating:
-- Be prepared for some disruption in your home, affecting kitchen, workspace, sleeping space
-- Consider the overall potential value of your home and the most you think you could sell it for in your area.
-- When investing in huge add-ons, renovations, or improvements, it’s a good idea to consider how long you intend to stay there and what you might be able to recover if you were to sell compared to what you put in. In some cases, you won’t care as it’s a much needed or desired renovation. In other instances, it’s a good check and balance for the decision to move forward.


* For home improvement projects, it is important to have a physical or digital log to track completed work, inspection approvals, and contractor information. 
-- Keep track of before vs after photos/reords
-- Be sure to record what was done, when it was done, who provided the service, and how much you paid. This may come in handy if you have to follow up or you would like to refer others.


* Keep records also for work that still needs to be done. Save pictures or files according to the project or room. When you are ready to have the work done, you should have some visuals to show your contractors or your local home improvement store.  


* Some projects may require permits and/or checking with HOA


* Handyman vs contractor
-- Some minor projects are small enough to be handled on your own or by a handyman, other projects such as larger updates or full remodels may require hiring a contractor.
-- Shop around, get estimates and check references




CONTRACTOR:

* When hiring a contractor for renovations, it’s important to shop around, get estimates, and check references.
--  In addition to online reviews, consider asking friends, neighbors, and your real estate agent for recommendations on service providers they’ve used. Conduct phone interviews and/or meet face to face so you can get a feel for how you might work together.


* A good contractor 
-- is not necessarily the cheapest
-- Renovating a home is stressful. A good contractor will understand that and be willing to work with you. It should be just as important to them that they fulfill your request as it is to you.
-- Has the appropriate licenses and insurance for your home improvement project.


* Some projects may require permits, so you will need to discuss whether they’re required and who will obtain them. 
-- Some projects may require HOA approval - you'll have to do it


* Once you’ve found the right contractor for the job, there are some things you need to keep in mind.
-- Keep an open line of communication.  
-- Keep a written log of all changes discussed. Do NOT verbally or suddenly agree/disagree to anything, or change plans.

-- Discuss your expectations upfront before construction begins
--|---- What is needed? What are the options to achieve it? 
--|---- What is "definition of done" - is it when contractor says it is done, or when homeowner says? How to independently verify/inspect that the work is properly done? What if inspection fails?
--|---- When the work will be started and completed? What are the intermediate work segments?
--|---- What to do if project won't be finished in time?
--|---- Will there be daily cleanup,  and any special care that needs to be taken, such as not stepping on flowers or making sure all stray nails are picked up?
--|---- Are any permits required for the work? Who obtains it - you or contractor?

-- Agree on a payment structure that works for you both.
--|---- Contractor agrees to only ask for payment agreed to in contract. Any cost changes must be reflected in contract and jointly agreed to by contractor and homeowner. 
--|---- Try to arrange progressive efforts with progressive payout.
--|---- For each progressive effort and for the full effort, try to get agreement on expected cost, and max allowed cost. Add in contract that the value must not go above expected cost without your approval; And not above the max cost at all.
--|---- Contractor agrees to receiving only the payments for which they can provide a valid receipt. The recipt must identify the effort that was finished, which must match contract expectation (so, receipt cannot be issued for unfinished work. Contractor must identify why they feel the work is done, and homeowner must identify why they feel it is not done). On payment, the recipt must be stamped with payment acknowledged - or, they must provide a bank account to transfer funds. A mechanics lien will not be pursued for effort for which a recipt isn't provided, or if the receipt is for material/effort which is not in contract. Contractor agrees that payment of receipt indicates the segment work is completed.
--|---- If a material/labor cost from a work segment will get used in subsequent checkpoint effort, then the contractor agrees to not charge it doubly. So, combined charges from all work segments must be same as if the entire effort was done without segments.
--|---- The final work segment is for owner to verify that effort done in all previous work segments have achieved the expected final result. So, effectively, a portion of payment will be paid after the last segment, which verifies that the project is completed satisfactorily.

-- Discuss liabilities:
--|---- Homeowner does not go in work area, except for mutually agreed work segment end verification, or to address emergency requests. It is contractor's job to ensure homeowners safety when latter is in work area for work segment end inspection. If area is unsafe to enter after work hours, contractor must tape the area to indicate it. Contractor is exempt from ensuring homeowner's safety if homeowner breaks the expectation.
--|---- From above, Homeowner is not liable for any injury to contractor or subcontractor.
--|---- Contractor is liable for damages to homeowner's property that is not a part of work.
--|---- Homeowner only reimburses a single entity (primary contractor) for the work payment. Homeowner are exempt from dealing directly with subcontractor or hardware cost.
--|---- Contractor agrees that after that payment of final receipt, the homeowner can file a Notice of Completion with the county recorder's office.
--|---- Contractor agrees that they will send a preliminary notice before filing a Mechanics lien,giving homeowner at least 30 days to comply.

-- During work progress:
--|---- Be proactive in checking the contractor’s work throughout the process. 
--|---- If any new changes are needed: why? why was it previously not identified? Is it really needed or good to have? Don't immediately agree.. double check the recommendation - internet search maybe? If it is needed, then update contract - don't do things verbally
