BUYER's VS SELLER'S AGENT

The buyer’s agent is the real estate agent working with the homebuyer (you). They represent you during the purchase of your home.  

The person selling their home usually has a real estate agent as well. They’re called the seller’s agent or listing agent. The seller’s agent helps the seller market and sell the home. The fees or commission used to pay for both the buyer’s and the seller’s agent usually come from the sales proceeds at settlement and are paid for by the seller.




QUESTIONS TO ASK REAL ESTATE AGENT

* Do you work primarily with buyers or sellers? 
-- Buying a home requires a different skill set than selling one. While an agent may very well do both, some may specialize in one or the other. 


* How well do you know the area I’m interested in? Have you ever lived there? Have you sold homes there recently?
-- This will provide insight into how well an agent knows the market. Ask them to share recent experience with homes in a price range similar to yours.
-- Don't just directly ask the question verbatim as it looks conspicuously interview-y. Try to get the information in some informal way, and also do google search


* What states are you currently licensed and certified to sell real estate in?
-- Real estate agents need to have a state license and certification. Make sure that they are up to date; otherwise, this could become an issue when it’s time to make the offer.


* How long have you been in the real estate industry? How long as a real estate agent? Tell me a little bit about the benefits of working with your company.
-- Agents and agencies with more experience are typically more efficient and better understand what does and doesn’t work well in the homebuying process.  
-- Don't just directly ask the question verbatim as it looks conspicuously interview-y. Try to get the information in some informal way, and also do google search


* Do I have to sign a contract for your services and if so, can I cancel without penalty?
-- This is important in case you decide you want to find another agent to work with or decide to put your house hunt on hold.


* Can you explain how your commission works? Are there any costs I might be responsible for paying as we look for a home?
-- While the commission for most real estate agents is paid by the seller, it’s still a good idea to make sure that you are not responsible for any additional commission or fees to your agent during the process.


* When is the best time of the day to communicate? What is your preferred method of communication?


* Do you have references that I could contact to ask some questions about their homebuying experience with you?
-- References can be a good way to get insight on how an agent is to work with, so be sure to ask past clients specific questions in areas important to you. For example, was the agent responsive, reliable, professional, knowledgeable?
-- Don't just directly ask the question verbatim as it looks conspicuously interview-y. Try to get the information in some informal way, and also do google search
