INSPECTION:

* Take photo during inspection. These can be used to compare against during the final walk through - to verify that new damages didn't occur after the inspection


* You and your real estate agent will want to be at the property while the inspection takes place so that you can ask questions of the inspector along the way. The seller is usually asked to leave the home during this event. 


* During the home inspection, if certain areas of the home concern you, make sure to point those out.


* You can also ask questions about general maintenance and care for various items.


* If you're unsure about something you see or that your inspector says, make sure to ask for clarification


* Pests, asbestos, lead, radon, mold - are not something inspector does, but they can ask for it. Either ways, good to get it done


* Inspection questions:
-- See checklist
-- Where is the electrical panel located? Is it labeled properly?
-- Where are water shut off valves located? Is there a single shutoff valve?
-- Do things look ok when water is started? Or, are there internal leaks?




APPRAISAL:

* A home appraisal will establish a market value that will be used to calculate the amount of money that will be lent to you for the mortgage. 


* Your mortgage lender will schedule the appraisal with a licensed appraiser. Although your lender makes the arrangement, you are responsible for the cost of the appraisal. 


* During the appraisal, the appraiser will assess the home’s general condition, age, location, lot size, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, updates, major structural improvements like remodeling and additions, and any additional features, such as an in-ground swimming pool. Appraisers are trained to avoid giving opinions about the home, its decorations, or cleanliness. When determining the home’s value, an appraiser will consider sales of similar homes within the area as well as their neighborhood and market.
