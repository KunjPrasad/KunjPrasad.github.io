* Real estate agent will help you determine an amount, but in the end, the "decision is yours". 
-- Your agent will show you the prices of homes sold within the area and how high the demand is for them. Can also use Redfin / Zillow to look at sold homes
-- If demand is high (how long was the unit listed for) and multiple buyers show interest in the same home, your agent may suggest that you add an escalation clause to your contract (meaning: you will increase your offer under the terms of the clause) and may help you win a bidding war. If the home is in high demand, be ready to move quickly. Your real estate agent may also suggest being flexible with parts of the process, such as the closing date.


* Make sure to avoid offers that are too low. It could cause you to lose the home you want.


* You’ll also need to consider if your offer is contingent. This refers to the conditions that you’d want the seller to meet in order to move forward with the purchase of the home. This could include results from the home inspection, the appraisal, or your home loan getting approved.


* Earnest money
-- Higher is better; But, don't go very high - you can lose it if sale falls through


* (I am assuming...) After the seller and seller's agent ratify your purchase offer, that is when you need to fix a single lender out of many from whom you took pre-approvals. See "On Lenders" for getting loan estimate and reviewing it


* This may be a good time to start getting moving quote, since a move is almost final. Also consult with buyer's agent.
