				<h2>Unofficial promoter</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www.theeastindiacompany.com/" target="_blank">The East India Company (EIC)</a> (<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-east-india-company/" target="_blank">Linkedin</a>): ..because if you know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_India_Company" target="_blank">EIC's history</a>, then the meteoric impact of it being owned by an Indian is something that I believe should be celebrated. I would strongly encourage readers to buy from them.</li>
					<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Wilds" target="_blank">Outer Wilds</a>: ..because it is not just a game; It is a philiosophy on life!</li>

				<h2>Books</h2>
				<p>This section links to some of the books I'm writing or have written in past. All books are purposefully html formatted so that readers can add their own notes. It is described in each book on how to do so.</p>
				
				<h3>Books on software development</h3>
				<p>Writing production worthy web application codes that aren't bound to one single developer, welcomed by others in the team and are also easily extensible and maintainable.</p>

				<h3>Books on software engineer interview</h3>
				<p>Software engineer interviews always feels like a tricky process. The book tries to demystify it. Since there are already multiple books to help prepare for software interviews, I've tried to keep it short, and instead refer to other books weherever applicable.</p>
				<ul>
					<li><a href="/interview/interviewee">Preparing For Software Engineer Interview: Interviewee</a> (Not started)</li>
