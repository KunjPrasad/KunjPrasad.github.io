			<h1>Moving house in US</h1>
			<div class="author-container"><a href="/">Kunj Prasad</a></div>
			<p>For some reason, you need to move house. Maybe you got a new job offer, or you are just bored and want to move to a new neighborhood. Up until recently, I never had too many items to pack, so I'd pack my clothes in suitcase, kitches utensils in bubble wrap, nicely and compactly pack them in trunk or on back seat of car, and move. However, in the most recent move this wasn't possible and I hired a packing and moving service. The article contains some details about the experience that I hoped would be commonplace and easily searchale, but I wasn't able to find it.</p>
			<p>Few things to note: (1) This is written for US context. I am not sure how much it would apply to a different setting. (2) The details in this article are based on my experience. It is to help introduce the readers to the process. However, industry practices can change over time and one should always clarify the details about any binding service agreement before signing it, and not rely solely on this article. In short, I'm disclaiming myself from all liabilities. (3) Technically, one can physically move the entire house. This is not about that, but about moving furnites, clothing, etc. from one place to another.</p>

			<h2 id="packing-and-moving">Packing and moving</h2>
			<p>You want to move the furniture, clothes, kitchen items, etc. from your current location to a new location. This starts with getting one/more empty container(s) from the moving service providers where your items will get stored. We'll go into details of these providers later on. Once you have a container, you can schedule for service from packers who will go through each items in your house (..really, each item) and pack them in boxes. The boxes can now be stored in the empty container. Once the packing is done, the movers pick up the container and move it to the destination location. At destination, you can get service providers to move the packed boxes from the container to desired floor of the house or apartment. This is a quick summary of the packing and moving process. Let's go into details for each step.</p>
			
			<h3 id="getting-packing-container">Getting packing container</h3>
			<p>The 3 main providers for empty container (..that I know of) are U-Haul's U-Box, U-Pack and Pods. Though I enquired on how to use their service, I haven't ever used it. I strongly suggest readers to do their research. This is my understanding of how it works. All 3 service gives you an empty container. Either you can tow the empty container from the service provider's location to your address using your vehicle (this is generally the case of U-Box), or they can drop off the container at your location for a charge. Once you get the box, you can take a couple of days to pack your items in there and then lock the container (you put your own lock). Few important things to keep in mind are: (1) Your apartment complex or home owners association (HOA) may have rules on where the containers can be placed. So , check with them before you make a reservation. (2) Some of the service providers may have a requirement that a trailer should be able to enter the apartment complex and up to the location where the container must be dropped off. If your apartment has narrow, winding, or tree-arched roads, then that may limit the available options. (3) Each service provider has a different size box. (4) At least for U-Box, I noticed that going from 3 boxes to 4 boxes does not change the price as much as going from 4 to 5 boxes. So, do research the cost associated with different count of boxes (and the size of each box) to identify the option which is most suited for your needs.</p>
			
			<h3 id="packing-items">Packing items</h3>
			<p>The packing service provider has crew members who will go through every item in your house and will pack them in cardboard boxes. Not a huge stretch of imagination visualizing them packing the clothes. For fragile items like electronic and kitchenware, the crew members will wrap it with packing paper to prevent items from cracking or breaking due to colliding with one another or getting jostled during the move. The experience of crew member factors a lot in this step because you'd want more fragile items to be given extra padding / support. Bulky furnitures are also wrapped with blankets and/or bubble wrap to ensure that the item's surface is protected against minor or deep scratches / chipping. To make the most of available container space, they may disassemble furniture. I haven't worked with a service provider that only does packing and not moving, so I don't know if: (1) they will always bring in the packing cardboard boxes, packing sheets, packing tape of if you need to provide it to them on the day of packing. (2) If they always disassemble furniture, or if you have to instruct them to do so. Best to clarify it with the service provider so that there is no miscommunication or misalignment of expectations. As the items are getting packed, it's a good idea to also write a few word description about the contents on top of cardboard box. Another good practice is to write down the name of room from where the items are packed in the cardboard box, like bedroom-1, bedroom-2, living room, bathroom, kitchen, patio, etc. This is helpful when boxes are moved back from container to the new house or apartment at the destination (<a href="#moving-packed-items-at-destination">discussed later</a>). You may also want to make a list of packed boxes, giving each of them a number, and writing down the contents of each box and room. This list can eventually be used to verify that all boxes got moved.</p>
			
			<h3 id="moving-packed-items-at-source">Moving packed items at source</h3>
			<p>At this point, the items has been packed but are still inside the house or apartment, and possibly at different floors. This step involves someone physically moving the packed boxes to the empty container which is sitting on the floor level. The benefit of using carboard boxes for packing items can be seen in this step; Without the use of cardboard boxes, it would be very hard to move the items and to pack them closely inside the container. The benefit of disassembling the furniture also show up; Without it, the container space couldn't have been properly / fully used. Just to repeat the obvious: Be mindful of placing heavier items at bottom and lighter items on top.</p>
			
			<h3 id="moving-items">Moving items</h3>
			<p>At this point, all packed items are in the container. If there is any empty space between the cardboard boxes and the container door, then it is highly recommended to secure the boxes using ropes. Doing so prevents the boxes from moving around during transportation and smashing with one another or against the containe door. You would also place a lock on container door (in addition to lock added by the moving service provider). At this point, the moving service provider would send a team to pick up the filled container to be loaded on some truck or 16-wheeler so that it can be moved to its final destination. For moves within city, a truck is sufficient. However, for moves to a different state, a 16-wheeler is used where multiple containers from same or different households are loaded together and moved in bulk. After the container has been moved, the container is dropped off at the destination, i.e., your new apartment or house.</p>
			
			<h3 id="moving-packed-items-at-destination">Moving packed items at destination</h3>
			<p>This step is the reverse of <a href="#moving-packed-items-at-source">moving the packed items at source</a>. The goal is to have the packed cardboard boxes from the container be moved to corresponding room in the new house or apartment. This is where it is helpful to have the name of the room on cardboard box from where the items were initially packed. Using the list of box details made during the <a href="#packing-items">packing step</a>, it can be confirmed that all the boxes got moved. At this point, you should also be inspecting the cardboard boxes for damages, as they get moved into you new house / apartment. This can be useful for filing insurance claims. Do realize that this process may be more stressful that moving the packed items at source if you are moving all the items to a smaller house/apartment, or to a unit at a higher floor level.</p>
			
			<h3 id="unpacking-items">Unpacking items</h3>
			<p>There are 3 portions to this last step of unpacking items: unpacking items that don't need assembly, unpacking items that need assembly (like furniture) and discarding the packing material. <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you see a damaged item, then: (1) do NOT attempt to pull out other items, (2) take a photo of the damage while it is inside the cardboard box, (3) take a photo of the exterior of the cardboard box, (4) check with the insurance provider on how you should proceed, or proceed at your own risk!</p>
			
			<h4 id="unpacking-items-no-assembly">Unpacking items that do NOT need assembly</h4>
			<p>These include most of the items that are moved, like clothing, kitchen utensiles, etc. They were packed as-is and so, at destination, you need to remove them from the cardboard box and place it back at its new location. No catch.. just that it'll be a whole lot of work!</p>
			
			<h4 id="unpacking-items-with-assembly">Unpacking items that DO need assembly</h4>
			<p>This category mostly includes the furniture that were disassembled at source to enable efficient use of the moving container. At destination, the furniture now needs to be put together. Depending on how the move was done, the responsibility to do so will either go with the movers or with you. We'll discuss more about it later, and this is one of the big advantages of using a company that does both packing and moving.</p>
			
			<h4 id="discard-packing-materials">Discarding packing materials</h4>
			<p>This seemingly simple last step can become  a slight headache depending on your local HOA or county rules. You'll suddenly be creating a whole lot of transh, consisting of cardboard boxes, packing paper, bubble wraps, etc. Depending on the recycle requirements or not wanting to overflow the trash container, you may want to discard them slowly and in proper bins.</p>
			
			<h2 id="pack-move-by-self">Packing and moving by self</h2>
			<p>Let's start with the cheapest method of packing and moving which is to do it by self. If there aren't lot of items to transfer and/or if moving on a budget, then this is a good way to move items. Sometime, it may be a better option to sell most/all your current items/furniture, and then move by self with very few items, and buy new furniture at destination. This can be good option if you are looking to get fancier items/furniture after you move compared to what you have now, or if the cost to move the items/furniture is similar to or more than what you'd pay if sell the current ones and get new ones at destination. When moving by self, manual effort to pack and move is provided by you and the unfortunate souls who identify themselves as your friends, and are simpleton enough to not escape getting pulled into the process. The vehicle used for moving is either owned by you, or by one of your family members, or by your friend, or maybe you rented a car, or a moving truck. Maybe you already have a car and rented an extra packing container with wheels that you'll tow with the car. The degree of packing can have a wide spectrum. On one end is haphazardly putting items in the vehicle, and the other end being packing the items neatly and utilizing every inch of available space.</p>
			<ul>Few things to note when moving by self:
				<li>Safety first:<ul>
					<li>You are driving a loaded vehicle and it will both accelerate and stop slower than usual. So, add an extra layer of patience AND risk-aversion on your driving compared to usual.</li>
					<li>A good idea is to also get the vehicle maintenance done before the travel. However, don't delay it till immediately before the travel, else you won't get time to put in a fix if an issue is identified.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>For moves involving overnight stops:<ul>
					<li>Packing items in trunk is more secure than packing them on the back seat. Items being visible on the back seat can make your car a target of vandalism. Check the safety of the area along your travel route. If you really need to store items on the back seat, then don't cut back when getting a hotel for overnight stay. A preferable choice would be a hotel with good rating, lit parking space, not an underground parking, not in downtown and also not totally outside the city.</li>
					<li>Pack a bag with items that you would need everyday, like toiletries (brush, toothpaste), change of clothes, etc. Pack it last in the car and keep it some place where you can easily pull it out every night and then pack it back when starting the trip the next day.</li>
					<li>Moves with overnight stops are extra stressful. Do consider treating yourself to good meal and good hotel stay to keep your mood from nose-diving.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>Note that even though it's not directly visible, moving by self takes a greater toll your car than usual drive. The shocks, struts of your car will be taking a heavier than normal damage because of the weight from items being moved. Placing the heavier items close to the rear wheels won't undo the damage but can be helpful and is much better than placing them closer to the edge of the trunk.</li>
				<li>Do check if you can send your items by USPS, UPS or Fedex. USPS accepts up to 40 lbs. of items that can be shipped (..I think). The advantage is that it will be cheaper than UPS or Fedex. The disadvantage is that when you start packing, then you may realize that 40lbs. isn't quite a lot! UPS or Fedex ship heavier items. If it bind, like, your vehicle doesn't have space to move certain items, or if there's not efficient way to pack multiple small items, then, maybe put them all in a box along with packing peanuts or papers, and ship them via UPS or Fedex. Just to mention.. you'd want to take the cheapest ground shipping option when sending items this way!</li>
				<li>Plan for contingencies: Don't plan for time-sensitive activities or deadlines immediately after your time. There can be unexpected delays from flat tire and traffic. Realize that since your trunk is packed with items, so pulling out a spare time in case of a flat might not be possible or would be very encumbering (to remove items from trunk, get the spare, and them pack them back). Also, after you've moved, your adrenalin levels will start to come down and you'll start feeling all the stress and aches the your body has been taking without complaint for the past few days during the move.</li>
				<li>If possible, take a scenic route and enjoy the drive! Plan for good meals along the way.</li>
			</ul>
	
			<h2 id="partial-service-provider">Using service provider for part of process</h2>
			<p>If not doing all the packing and moving by self, it is possible to have one or multiple parts of the <a href="#packing-and-moving">packing / moving process</a> be handled by corresponding service providers. For example, when <a href="#packing-items">packing items</a>, you can hire packers who will just pack the items in your apartment. Or maybe, you want to pack all items by yourself, and hire someone to take the packed boxes to the empty container. Same company / crew can be used for multiple steps, like, using same company for packing items and then taking the packed boxes to the container at source location. It is also possible to use same or different providers for different steps. So, you can use same or another company  to move the boxes out of the house at source and in to the new house / apartment at destination.</p>
			<p>A good reason to have a service provider handle a particular step in the moving process is when that step is overly cumbersome compared to others. For example, if you're having a bad back and don't want to strain yourself, or maybe you are in an apartment that is currently on 3rd floor and you are moving to a house having all rooms on ground floor, then hiring someone to move the packed boxes from house / apartment to the empty container at source can be a good choice, and at destination you can move the boxes yourself. Or maybe, you cannot take the day off work and want to have someone pack your items and move it to the empty container. </p>
			<p>The first and most obvious risk in working with a service provider is that they may have a bad track record, either due to inexperience, or bad customer service, or both. When searching for a service provider, it is helpful to google search for customer reviews, or check on Better Business Bureau (BBB) website if there are complaints against the provider, and choose ones that have a good rating and customer service.</p>
			<p>A major disadvantage associated with this option is that it may not be clear on who takes the responsibility for a damage to your items. Let's say you pack some items. A company / crew moves the packing boxes from your apartment at 3rd floor and stocked it up in the container. At destination, you notice that one of the box was crushed and that caused damage to the item. In this case, is it your fault for not packing the box properly, or is the fault of movers from improperly stacking the boxes in the container. Even if the mover provides an insurance option, it may not be possible to use it because it will not get established whether the damage was due to their fault. So, the low cost associated with this option comes with this risk. Even if you use a company for packing rather than doing it yourself, and use another company for moving the packed boxes, and both of them provide insurance options, still it cannot be identified who is at fault and so, it won't be possible to use the insurance from either of them to claim damages. If using this option, and your service provider tries to sell you the idea that you should give your business to them because they can insure the item, then you should really get into the nitty-gritties of how the insurance will work, how the liability is identified before you agree; And you should also verify that all infomation that was discussed is also present on the documents that you'll be signing.</p>
			<p>Another risk is that if there is a delay from the company in providing the service, then all other processes that depend on it will also get delayed. So, it is advisable to not schedule external services close to a deadline. For example, if you are hiring someone to move boxes, then it's advisable to not have them come on same day when the moving company expects that your container will be filled and they will pick it up. Any delay in moving the boxes will then upset the plan of having the movers carry your filled container.</p>
			
			<h2 id="complete-moving-service">Using complete moving service</h2>
			<p>The other end of spectrum which is totally opposite to <a href="#pack-move-by-self">packing and moving by self</a> is to have a company handle the complete process. So, it is the same company that will pack all your items in boxes, move the boxes to a container, move the container to destination and unload the boxes from container to your new home or apartment. One important feature that is distinctive of this option is that since the moving company handles the entire process, so, it is very clear that if any item is damaged when it is unpacked at destination, then it is solely the fault of the moving company. This contrasts wildly with services from, say, U-haul, which is responsible from providing you will a container and for moving the container; And while its website can contain links to other service providers who can pack and load/unload the boxes in the container, U-haul won't take responsibility for damage due to improper packing and loading service handled by providers mentioned on its website (side-note: This is what I understood about the process, but I'd suggest clarifying the same with them). Bottom line: When using an end-to-end moving service, the responsibility for damage to items will always be with the moving company. This is a big peace of mind that this option provides.</p>
			
			<h3 id="get-move-estimate">Getting a moving estimate</h3>
			<p>When using an end-to-end moving service, it starts getting an estimate for the items that need to be moved. For this, you'll need to go around your apartment with your phone camera, taking video of one room at a time, identifying each and every item to be moved. For this step, some companies allow the option of taking video by yourself, identifying every item, and then uploading it on their website. Other companies instead rely on an agent who'll meet up with you at a scheduled time via a phone app, and look at your phone's video to identify the items. In either case, the goal is to have someone look at all the items that need to be moved and create an estimate for the moving boxes needed and identify the corresponding level of effort. This is turn guides the initial estimate for the moving process. One advantage of latter option where an agent is looking at your video, is that they can ask for clarifications that can otherwise get overlooked, like, is the couch made of leather or fabric, is the furniture detachable, is your bed frame electrical? Two important things I'd note about this process are: (1) Do NOT buy furniture or big items after you've completed this step because that changes the moving estimate. (2) When taking video, highlight for each item if they are electrical or not, and also if they are of unexpectedly high value.</p>
			<p>NOTE that getting an estimate is supposed to be a non-binding step. You shouldn't be asked to put in a down payment or confirm that you'll be using only that service provider. However, some providers ask to pay a portion of the estimate to "lock down" the estimate provided. This is separate and is covered in the next section on signing contract. For the purpose of providing an estimate, it is generally expected to be non-binding.</p>
			
			<h3 id="signing-contract">Signing contract</h3>
			<p>Once you get the estimate, the next step would be to enter into a legally binding contract with the moving service provider. Before you sign the contract, you'd want to broadly do 2 things: (1) Get estimates from different service providers and have a good understanding of how the entire moving process will work, including, what aspects are covered by insurance and what aren't covered, and, (2) Compare different options, the corresponding price and the included features, and read reviews about each moving service at least on Google, Yelp and BBB, and identify the service that you plan to use. You can also use recommendations from friends who have previously moved or from your company by asking them for moving service that they use to relocate new hires (if applicable). NOTE that many big-name moving companies like United Van Lines, Mayflower, etc. work via local independent providers, who provide the moving service. In this case, you'd want to read the reviews about the local provider.</p>
			<p>Some questions that can be asked before signing the contract are listed below. I'd suggest asking questions as if you are doing the move for the first time so that you can clarify the terms of service as provided by that company and not assume that it's automatically included just because some other company in the past also provided that service. I would also suggest asking more questions than less. One big reason to ask more questions is that if the agent isn't patient enough in answering your questions now, then chances are high that they won't be patient enough to hear your complaints after the move. Personally, I chose to send questions over email, so that they have time to prepare a response, and then I called them to get the answer, because talking on phone is faster. Even better, after you receive the response, write it back in an email and send it back to the agent. This keeps a paper trail of communication between the two. <strong>ALSO NOTE:</strong> Read the contract before signing it to verify that it includes that were discussed over phone/email. For example, if the agent says that they reimburse for delays, but you don't see it anywhere in contract, then ask for clarification on why it's not there in contract, or if you might have overlooked. If it is just a "policy statement", or anything not on contract, don't count on that condition to apply. Best to not use such providers.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ask if the agent has looked up the source and destination address on google maps, and if they can confirm that a truck can come to the nearest parking lot. If the entrance has low hanging trees, narrow roads, etc., or if the apartment complex only allows trucks to be parked in certain spaces, then you should discuss it with the agent.</li>
				<li>Ask for breakdown of total moving cost by different service: How much are packing cost, moving cost and insurance cost? Are there any other costs in addition to these 3 major ones? This helps you realize the following:<ul>
					<li>Identify whether you really need a service or if that can be skipped. For example, I noticed that by packing all items by myself, I'd be reducing moving cost by 15&percnt; but taking on a whole lot of headache. So, it would be good to just have them also pack the items, rather than doing it myself.</li>
					<li>If you see one company adding a particular service charge in estimate, but the other is not doing so, then you can ask the other company if they will still provide the corresponding service. For example, if one provider is putting extra charge to assemble/disassemble adjustable furniture like electric bed frame, Ashley or Lazboy furnitures, etc, and the other provider is not putting that charge, then confirm with other provider if they will still provide the service.</li>
					<li>Identify it some charges can be reverted. For example, one charge was optional dependent on whether a huge trailer can come in the apartment complex.</li>
					<li>Ask if it is possible to have packers come on a particular date at source / destination. The general answer is: Yes, but costs extra. You can try to get information on how much extra it'll be.</li>
					<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Ask if you will need to pay extra at anytime outside what you agree upon when signing the contract. If the answer is anything other than a "Yes", for any reason, it's best to not go with the service provider.</li>
					<li>Ask what forms of payment they accept. If credit card is accepted, ask if it is possible to split the overall charge among different cards.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>Can the cost change?<ul>
					<li>What if during the estimate, it was identified that 30 packing boxes were needed, but you end up needing 40 boxes? Will this cause a change in service cost?</li>
					<li>What if the total weight of all items is different from what was estimated - does it change the cost? - Just to mention, when I was looking for moving companies, one of them said that the cost is fixed, while the other said that it can vary.</li>
					<li>For long distance moving, you can also ask if the cost will change depending on changes in gas prices.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>What are the various insurance options? What do each of them cost and what they cover? Are there limitations to when the insurance applies?<ul>
					<li>If you pack on your own, then the insurance towards damaged item may not apply because it cannot be identified with certainty if the moving company is responsible for the damage because of improper moving, or if you are responsible for damage because of improper packing. This is another reason to just have the company handle the packing service also.</li>
					<li>Does insurance cover the item by its price, or a flat rate based on the weight of item. Generally, it's by item's price, but do confirm it.</li>
					<li>How is a damage to an item handled?<ul>
						<li>I see a damaged item. What should I do? Common answer is: If you identify the item as broken while it is in box, then ideally take the photo of damaged item within the box itself. If you can, do not unpack the box. Do not try to repair the damage yourself. Follow the process of filing a claim.
						<li>How do I report a damaged item for insurance claims? Common answer is: Take a photo of damage and send it to them along with the price estimate.</li>
						<li>Does it help with insurance if I take a photo of  items before they are packed as a proof of their condition before the move? Common answer is: It's likely not needed, but feel free to take it for your record. My suggestion: Yes, take it. For furnitures and leather covers, you'd want to show that surface is smooth, furniture legs aren't misshapen. For all other items in the house, particularly the electronics, take pictures showing the item front front and back (more on electronics later)
						<li>How is a surface scratch, chipping, deeper damage handled? Is the damaged unit replaced in full or is it only repaired? Common answer is: you file a claim. If it is minor or if item is of low cost, you'll be reimbursed, else an agent will come to inspect and identify the next steps. <strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Do confirm whether you get reimbursed the original cost of item, or if it is depreciated based on item's usage. If it is latter, then how is the depreciation calculated.</li>
						<li>If applicable, you'd want to ask on how they handle leather damages? Unlike a wooden damage, the value of an item decreases a whole lot if there is a tear in the leather or fabric. A leather repair may not fully restore the item's worth.</li>
						<li>How do they handle damage to set-of-items? Like one cup in the set gets broken, or one chain in the dining room furniture gets broken? Common answer is: We try to repair it, else replace that item. Mayflower, though, said that they will replace the entire set if it cannot be repaired.</li>
						<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> How is damage to electronics handled? For me, some companies said that they only cover cosmetic damage to items. So, if your TV looks good, but is not starting, that's not covered. Mayflower (side-note: I'll be repeating a whole lot of Mayflower here because that's the only company I've used. There is also a <a href="#move-experience-2020-mayflower">separate section</a> about my recent move experience with Mayflower.) said that they also cover functional damage. So, they cover the case if TV looks good but is not starting. When asked about whether I should take video of the electronic items to show that its working before the move and if it can help with insurance, I was told that I can take a video but it may not be used. However, I strongly suggest taking a video.</li>
					</li></ul>
					</li>How long do I have after the move to file claims? Try to get something that gives you at least 30 days because setting items in the new place will take some time.</li>
					<li>On average, how long does it take to process the claims?</li>
					<li><strong>SIDE NOTE:</strong> Questions like how is damage reported, should you take photos, how long it takes to process claims test the agent's knowledge of the complete move process. If the agent has an answer to these questions, it shows their experience. However, if the agent you are talking to doesn't know about these details, and also don't offer to follow up on the conversation and provide you with this information later, then that's likely a "red flag" of potential poor customer service.</li>
				</ul></li>
				<li>Which company would you be dealing with? This is because there will be a company at source location which will pack items, and there may be same/different company at destination which will unload. If you have any concerns, are you dealng with one company, or two separate companies? You want to clarify it for 2 main reasons: (1) It's far more headache dealing with 2 entities, each passing the responsibility to other and have you move in a tail-spin, and, (2) It's even a bigger headache dealing with who is responsible for insurance claims. When using an end-to-end service provider, you should only be dealing with one company, and that's the big advantage of this option. So, do make sure that this applies!</li>
				<li>On the day of packing, will you be given an inventory of items packed? The industry standard answer is: Yes, as your items get packed in boxes, the movers will make a list of boxes packed, the room from where the items were packed and corresponding brief description of items in the box.</li>
				<li>If applicable, you should ask about what are the company's policy regarding reporting and handling of high value items? Are they covered under some separate insurance? High value items are things like expensive fur clothing, art piece, antique items, etc.</li>
				<li>If you have special furnitures, like Ashley or Lazboy couch, you can ask if the packers and movers have experience removing and reattaching the furniture parts. Expect the answer to be nothing other than a Yes! ..but is still a good question to ask.</li> 
				<li><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> Ask about what are the company policy regarding delays in day of packing and delivery delay at destination; Specifically, will you be compensated for the delay. This is an important discussion and is covered in a <a href="#delay-compensation">section</a> below.</li>
				<li>Is there any insurance provided by company for damage to house / apartment at source or destination by movers? I'd recommend having this discussion if the flooring is wooden. Common answer is: This is an extremely rare ocuurence. However, the company should provide that insurance, and it should not be relying on your home-owner's insurance.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3 id="delay-compensation">Compensation for delays</h3>
			<p><strong>IMPORTANT!</strong> This point is so important that I want to discuss it in its own section. One of the important questions to ask the agent is that what happens in case there is a delay is packing the items or delivering it to destination. The point to pay particular care to is that if you will be compensated for the delays. Generally, the way things work is that packers are expected to show up on a day, pack every item in house and put it in the truck. A delivery window is given, generally one week long, with the expectation that you will be present at the destination to accept the moved items which will be delivered within the delivery window. This means that after the items have been packed, you will be driving/flying out of your current location to the new location. So, what happens if the packers are not able to show up on the date and you miss your flight? Or, what happens if your items are not delivered to you at destination within the delivery window, and you have to sleep in a hotel (..or good old floor), and order food from restaurant for a longer period?</p>
			<p>When packers don't show up on the designated packing date, then it can affect your future schedule. So, you should choose a moving service provider that agrees to compensate you for delays in packing. Normally, packers show up on time, but it's still good to have some compensation assurance in case they don't. Even more important is to ask if you can get compensated for delays in delivery of your items at destination outside the agreed dropoff window. <a href="https://www.sparefoot.com/self-storage/blog/6139-what-to-do-if-your-mover-holds-your-belongings-hostage/" rel="noopener noreferrer">This article</a> suggests that there is a possibility where movers can keep your items hostage. My suggestion would be to go with a service that is required to compensate you for delays in delivery outside the dropoff window, and <strong>for whatever reason!</strong></p>
			
			<h3 id="move-service-timeline">Timeline for moving service</h3>
			<ul>Following is a general timeline for moving processes:
				<li>Around 7 weeks before the target date of packing, start searching for moving companies. Do online research, read reviews for a week.</li>
				<li>Around 6 weeks before the target date of packing, start taking appointments to review the items in house that need to be moved. Get quotations, discuss your question with agents. Give it a week.</li>
				<li>Take a few days to collect all information, go over it and identify the service provider you want to use. Get the contract form, read it to make sure that all points that you discussed with the agent are mentioned. By the time, you sign contract, it'll be 5 weeks before the target date of packing. This is a good span and it may not be possible to get any sooner time slot.</li>
				<li>For the next 5 weeks, slowly go over all your items (..mainly, clothing, shoes, bags, electronics) and sell/donate/discard any that you will not use. You don't need to pack, but it's a good time to identify items that you don't plan to use. Enjoy the last month at you current address.</li>
				<li>1 week before moving, see section on <a href="#packing-tips">moving tips</a>. If any apply to you, the use it if feel it'd be a good idea.</li>
				<li>On the day of packing, keep a free day because packers will be in your house from morning to evening. The packers will not ask of any help, and they are really good and fast, and yet, careful! Enjoy the lack of stress, the tension in your head that you're not feeling because the packers are taking care of it! The general way it works is that after your home items are put in a box and the box is sealed, a number will be put on the box, along with a small description of items in box and the room from where the items were picked. This is useful when delivering the boxes at destination. These details are also put in a paper and you'll be provided a copy of it at end of the day. The packers will also disassemble the furniture so that it can be packed closely. If your home gets damaged while the packers are working, then make a note so that you can file an insurance claim, and immediately follow up on it.</li>
				<li>Maybe 1.5-2 week from the date of packing, your items will show up at destination. A crew will unload it and bring it to your house. Do expect to have the door(s) of you new house or apartment/building be propped open as items are brought in, but unlike packing, this will be done within 2-3 hours. The way it works is that you'll get a paper with box numbers that were loaded. You can compare it to the paper you got from movers, and both should have same count of box numbers. As the crew brings up boxes, they will announce the box number and only then you should cross the number off from the list. There may be some items that don't have numbers because the number fell off during the move. Just make a note of it separately so that you can verify it at end using the box numbers that didn't get crossed off and the description of items corresponding to the box number in the list provided by the movers. They will also assemble all the furniture items that were disassembled at the destination. Make a list of any missing items or ones that can immediately be seen as broken. <strong>Regarding crossing-off box numbers, DO NOT:</strong> (i) allow anyone except yourself to cross off the box numbers, (ii) pre-emptively cross off a box-number, (iii) cross off on a box number that hasn't been delivered regardless of what is said. Also, <strong>DO NOT</strong> sign off unless you feel that the furniture has been properly and securely assembled.</li>
				<li>At this point, all your items have moved. Hurray, the hectic part of moving process is done! Slowly, work towards arranging them at new location, and also slowly discarding the packing boxes, papacking paper, etc.</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h2 id="packing-tips">Some moving tips</h2>
			<p>Provided below are certain tips/tasks that can be done at various steps in the moving process.</p>
			
			<h3 id="tips-before-packers-come">Some things to do before packers come</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Take photo of furniture, clothes, electronics - everything! Partcularly for furniture, take photo that shows the smooth finish of the surface.</li>
				<li>Take video of all electronics (or at least the most important ones) showing that it is working.</li>
				<li>Collect all remotes in a single bag. I know some Lazboy units have remote on side of the couch. Hunt down all the small, loose remotes and collect them at one location. This will make it extremely easy to find all the remote after you've moved, rather than wondering which box did a remote get packed in, or if it got lost! Along similar lines, you can collect ac adapters, extension cord, chargers, wires in a single box/bag so that it does not get misplaced and can be found easily.</li>
				<li>Let's say you have curtain rods, which are affixed to walls using screws and holders. I'm not sure if movers will also open the curtain rod screws, wall hanging screws, etc. When I had to move, I opened the screws myself. Then I took the set of screws used by an equipment (a rod, or a wall hanging, etc.), wrapped them with a paper on which I wrote the name of equipment that used the screw, and then encased the paper and screw together by a transparent packing tape. This way, the screws for an equipment stay together and don't get lost. Collect all these "packs" of screws in a single bag, so that after the move, you know easily where to look for them.</li>
				<li>If you use command strip mounts, they can be collected together.</li>
				<li>Collect all medicine supplies at one location so that it can be packed in a single box.</li>
				<li>My suggestion would also be to collect all free-hanging small photos that are not in a frame at one place because they can otherwise get easily misplaced.</li>
				<li>If you have vacuum cleaner, or Roomba, make sure that the dust buckets are empty. No point transporting dirt! For roomba, drain its battery so that it doesn't start cleaning in the packed box if its button gets accidentally pressed :P</li>
				<li>Just a reminder.. don't start packing everything by yourself. That's what the packers are for. You'd want to just collect small items together than can otherwise get easily misplaced.</li>
				<li>Prepare an area where you can sit while the packers are packing all other items in your house/apartment. You can also keep here the items that you don't want them to pack, making it a "no-pack zone". A <a href="#cross-over-stay">later section</a> identifies some of the items that will be needed during the time after all items at current location have been packed and before they are delivered to the new address. These items can also be stored in the "no-pack zone"</li>
			</ul>
			
			<h3 id="tips-after-delivery">Some things to do after items are delivered</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>DO NOT</strong> wait till after delivery to check that they are properly setup. Best to do it while the unloaders are working.</li>
				<li>While unpacking items, be on lookout for any damage to them. For furnitures, check the corners, surface and joint between 2 surfaces for any damage. Particularly, feel for damage on couch, chairs, etc. furnitures that have cloth or leather cover on it. The only way I know to test for damage in these items is if one part of furniture is able to twist around while the other part is held fixed; This means that there is some internal damage, otherwise no part should be able to twist freely.</li>
				<li>Check all major electrical items that they are working, like, TV, microwave, electrical furniture, kitchen appliances.</li>
				<li>Before discarding the boxes, check inside to verify that there are no items. Then flatten the boxes before discarding them. This helps you pack more boxes in the trash/recycle bin.</li>
				<li>Before discarding the packing paper, my suggestion would be to flatten it. The main reason is to ensure that there are no small items in the paper that are mistakenly getting discarded. Also, this helps you pack more paper in the trash/recycle bin.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2 id="cross-over-stay">Preparing for cross-over stay</h2>
			<p>Let's say that you live in an apartment, and are moving from San Francisco, CA to Austin, TX.. which is a very long distance move! The packers are coming on, say, October 1, and you have been given a delivery window between October 15-25 in Austin. This sections asks the question: What happens between October 1 and the date when you get the item delivery at destination.</p>
			<p>After the packers have gone though the apartment in San Francisco, CA, there won't be any items left. How/where will you cook or eat, and where will you sleep? How about work - in case you don't want to take 20 day long vacation? My suggestion: (1) Keep a water filter, like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Brita-Pitchers-36205-Everyday-Pitcher/dp/B01FXN3E74/ref=sr_1_5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brita</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PUR-Classic-Filtration-Indicator-Replacement/dp/B00IK5A68I/ref=sr_1_5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pur</a>. This can provide you with water. Maybe, you already have it, in which case, keep one of it separate so that it doesn't get packed. (2) To cover food.. if you want to splurge during the transition period, then it's totally fine to rely on restaurants and food delivery to cover your food needs. However, if you are on budget, then it may be worthwhile to keep a few pans, cutting board, a knife and a diswashing liquid separate and not have it packed. These can be used to prepare food. (3) Of all, the most troublesome would be to set up a temporary sleeping mattress arrangement. If you can borrow one from your friend/relatives, then that's the best option. Otherwise, you can either get an air mattress with inbuilt pump (..or buy the pump separately), like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intex-Comfort-Dura-Beam-Internal-Electric/dp/B0869FJCVG/ref=sr_1_3" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intex</a>. Another option is to buy a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=4+inch+mattress+topper+firm&s=price-asc-rank&sprefix=4+inch+mattress&ref=sr_st_price-asc-rank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mattress topper</a>, and keep a bed cover that can be used with it. I would also suggest going with a 2-3 inch topper and not the 4-inch one because the latter does't provide support and you'll wake up with a back pain. For side sleepers though, using a 4-inch topper may be better else they will feel the hard floor. The mattress topper or airbed is not the best option for sleeping, but it's better than sleeping on hard floor. Alternatively, you can just get a <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=queen+mattress&sort=price_low" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mattress</a>. If it gets cold, then a comforter can also be kept separate. (4) For sitting, working or as a dining table, a good option can be to have a foldable picnic table with <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=foldable+picnic+table+with+chair&ref=nb_sb_noss_2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">chairs</a> or <a href="https://www.walmart.com/search?q=card+table" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">card table</a>. (5) Keep some toilet supplies separate.</p>
			<p>Unless you are driving from starting location to destination in your car, or if you don't have space in your car for these items, then you'll have to discard these after using them for a few days at source location, and then you'll have to get another set at the destination. Alternatively, you may want to consider donating it, or just giving it to your friends.</p>
			
			<h2 id="moving-car">Moving car</h2>
			<p>Another important item that will need to be moved is your car. However, unlike the other items, you can choose to drive it by yourself. It may actually be a good, fun idea to take a big trip, stopping at scenic routes and enjoying the drive. Do note to keep some margin between the start and end date of the trip and any critical events. You may not know when if any issue comes up which can delay your plans. However, if your family has more than 1 car, and the household members don't want to drive a separate car from source to destination location, then it may be a good idea to just get all the cars moved by a car-moving service. These are far less stressful that packing/moving the items in apartment/house. Do note that cars are transported much faster as the truck drivers cover almost 12 hours driving daily. So, if you're thinking of having 1 car transported and driving the other car yourself, then realize that for you to collect the transported car at destination, you'll have to start driving no later than the next day after you give it to movers at source location, and you'll have to drive for ~8 hours daily. This won't be a pleasant drive, and so, if you want to transport at least one car, then it may be a good idea to have all cars be transported.</p>
			<p>It's easy to find a car moving service online. Alternately, you can just ask the company you chose to move your home items, and they should be able to provide/recommend some options. I would suggest making a reservation to move your car(s) almost 5 weeks or so before packers come to your apartment, i.e. on a similar timescale as selecting a moving service provider.</p>
			<p>The entire process for dropping off car is very simple. On the day of move, you'll get a call from the driver asking you to meet them at an address close to your apartment/home address. This is the address with a big enough parking lot where the driver can safely park the trailer and collect your car - you don't have to worry about finding the address, the driver will do it. It is recommended to clean the car so that they can identify the condition of car before it is collected. They also check the trunk to make sure that there are no extra items there. However, you can keep items that are generally used, like, tool set, clean cloth, gloves, jumper cables, small lumbar support pillows, etc. And that's it...! On the day when you'll be collecting the car, the same driver will contact you again and provide another address where you can collect the car. You can inspect the car when it is delivered, and that's the end of the process! Just in case you arrive at the destination and see that it cannot be used (..maybe because a new construction is going on, etc.), you can look at nearby Walmart, or mall or any area with big parking lot and coordinate the location for pickup.</p>
			<p>A small tip: I wouldn't suggest driving your car close to the pick up date at source location. The idea is just to avoid any unexpected occurrence, accidents, or tire punctures that can disrupt your plan of getting your car moved on the planned date.</p>
			
			<h2 id="move-experience-2021-mayflower">Move experience with Mayflower (2021)</h2>
			<p>In 2021, I did a long distance move from Texas to Maryland, including moving the car. For the move, I chose Mayflower. The reviews on Google and BBB were good. While the price was a little high, I liked that: (1) The agent was responsive, easy to reach, setup time for calls and answered all my questions both on phone and email. To me, this was indicative of good customer service. (2) their insurance covered electronic items not working even if it looks good after the moved. The other company I was considering did not guarantee it. (3) They covered replacement for "set" of items if one items in the set breaks. The other company I was considering did nit provide it. (4) They confirmed that the amount in the agreement/contact is the price I will pay regardless of whatever else changes. This proved beneficial for me because the gas prices went up, and shortage of drivers in following moths also raised the cost. (5) When I asked Mayflower if I'll be asked to pay extra because additional boxes got used to pack items, they said No! The other company I was considering said that they will weight the items in my house and the cost will increase if the item weight is more than expected. Although this is reasonable, I preferred having a fixed charge. I was uncomfortable with the uncertainty because if I am choosing a service because of low price quoted initially, then I prefer to not be given an extra charge later one. To me, that makes my entire decision process very confusing. (6) They provided a good delay reimbursement for missing to deliver the items within the window. I also got reimbursed because the delay, even though that was caused by shortage of workers and transporters, which is outside the company's control. (7) They did not charge me any upfront fees. I like this, rather than having to pay a down-payment of some sort for the service.</p>
			<p>The day of packing and unloading, both went good and stress free. They put down mats on the floor so that when they loaded the packed boxes and moved it using the dolley, it didn't leave any mark on the floor. The 2 most stressful portions of the entire move were because of me and not because of the moving company: (a) When the car was delivered at destination, the driver mentioned that one of the tires have a puncture. I'm not sure when it might have happened, and that's why the suggestion above to keep car driving to minimum before the date of loading. (b) I scheduled my flight the day before the car was being dropped off at destination. Unfortunately, the connecting flight got cancelled which stressed me for an hour. Thankfully, a new flight was made available after an hour. Also, I had 2 friends in the region, so I wasn't that stressed about it. This is why the suggestion above to not fly close to pickup date.</p>
