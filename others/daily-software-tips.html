			<h1>Minor tips to use during daily software development efforts</h1>
			<p>This page lists some minor tips for daily use for which I couldn't find a better page elsewhere</p>
		</header>
		<main>
			<h2>Prevent tracking</h2>
			<p id="prevent-tracking">Search for "top plugins to prevent tracking", and most of the answers will suggest using <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en" target="_blank">uBlock origin</a> or <a href="https://adblockplus.org/" target="_blank">adblock plus</a>, <a href="https://www.ghostery.com/" target="_blank">ghostery</a>, <a href="https://privacybadger.org/" target="_blank">privacy badger</a> and <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/disconnect/jeoacafpbcihiomhlakheieifhpjdfeo?hl=en" target="_blank">disconnect</a>. Additionally, take care to only use websites that start with <code>https://</code>, i.e. one that are secure. <a href="https://www.eff.org/https-everywhere" target="_blank">HTTPS Everywhere</a> is a good plugin to enforce this behavior (..although as of writing this, Jan-15, 2021, I've experience having https-everywhere activated as interfering with Google and Fidelity 2F login).</p>
			<p>Limit permissions to apps. On browser, this means restricting websites from accessing your microphone, camera and from knowing your location. For some reason, many sites want to know location, which, they will still be able to by using your ip-address. Still, why explicitly give more fine-grained location data. For smartphone users, make sure to limit the app permission rather than leaving it as default, particularly, the camera, microphone and location permissions. Not a part of reducing tracking, but more to reduce distraction..  I would suggest limiting the website's or app's ability to show notification, unless, it's critical for your work. For example: getting calendar notifications so you don't forget meeting is a critical requirement, but on your work computer, and not on your personal one!</p>
			
			<h2>Disable port scanning</h2>
			<p id="port-scanning"></p>I first came across this term when same was <a href="https://blog.avast.com/why-is-ebay-port-scanning-my-computer-avast" target="_blank">identified as being done by EBay</a>. The same article also explains that the scans are looking to see if someone is running a remote control service on user's computer, either knowingly or not. If positive, this could be a sign that the user's PC has been compromised by an attacker, who is trying to copy the user login credentials; And so, port scanning is a fraud prevention measure. To me, the suspicious part about it is that it is done automatically, without any user-consent and in background. So, unless it is looked for, a user will never know of it happening. If you want to block it from happening, then <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23246877" target="_blank">this article</a> can be useful. TL;DR: disable websocket using <a href="https://adblockplus.org/" target="_blank">adblock plus</a> or <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm?hl=en" target="_blank">uBlock origin</a>.</p>
			
			<h2>Use ModHeader plugin</h2>
			<p id="mod-header">At least in Chrome, a plugin called <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/modheader/idgpnmonknjnojddfkpgkljpfnnfcklj?hl=en" target="_blank">ModHeader</a> is available that can be put tosome great use. One great daily use is to add response headers of <code>X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff</code>, <code>X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block</code> and <code>X-Frame-Option: SAMEORIGIN</code>. Although these are almost standard, I've seen a couple of websites that sometime break apart, thereby signalling that it's not well made website. Another great use is if during development, you are running into CORS error; And while a good solution is to properly solve it, maybe you want a quick fix for the time being so that, let's say, you can do some demo. When needing a quick fix, use ModHear to add necessary CORS response header so that you can get the local development efforts working.</p>
			
			<h2>Change website rendering</h2>
			<p id="change-website-render">Have you landed on a website that has some flashing element which makes you dizzy, or just some annoying popup that remains there, or any general annoyance? Next time, when it happens, remember at back of your head that whatever is happening, is happening on <strong>your</strong> browser and so your have control over the content. If on chrome, open "Developer tools" (Ctrl + Shift + I; other browsers also provide developer tools) and go to "Elements" tab. In here, find the html element, or the css style that is giving you a headache and just remove it! You can also move the mouse to the desired html element on the webpage, right click and go to "Inspect Element". This should also open the "Elements" tab in "Developer tools".The only downside is that this is not permanent and if your load the page again, your update/delete you just did will be lost. But at least, there's a way! This is also useful if you don't want to change anything but want to understand how a website is working the way it is.</p>
			<p>This can be useful to close annoying modals that come over content (like, you can ony read after you subscribe, or after you disable adBlock, etc.). It may not get a perfect result, but is better than nothing in most cases. Also quite helpful is the use of <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/reader-mode/llimhhconnjiflfimocjggfjdlmlhblm?hl=en" target="_blank">reader mode</a> plugin. Most annoying popups and ads are designed to come on top of actual content, and so when switching to reader mode, they get filtered out. Truth be told, many websites that hide content behind paywall become accessible after swtching to reader mode!</p>
			<p>Finally, if you find yourself sitting before a laptop for long hours, you may prefer switching to "Dark mode". It's supported by Windows (..i'm guessing also by MacOS, but I haven't worked on it). Use <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dark-reader/eimadpbcbfnmbkopoojfekhnkhdbieeh?hl=en-US" target="_blank">Dark reader</a> on chrome to switch websites to dark mode.</a>
