			<h2 id="about-game">About the game</h2>
			<p>The <a href="https://www.mobiusdigitalgames.com/outer-wilds.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">page at Mobius Digital Games</a> and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outer_Wilds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wikipedia article</a> do a thorough job of providing relevant details about the game. For ones craving community involvement, there is also a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/outerwilds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subredditt</a> for Outer Wilds.  <strong>Be warned: I am not sure if they contain spoilers!</strong></p>
			
			<h2 id="what-i-like">What I like</h2>
			<p>Since it is an awesome game, there are many online reviews available for the game and its different aspects like, story, gameplay, visuals, audio, etc. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user reviews on Steam</a> is a good starting place. For me, the most striking feature of this game is the metaphysical implications of the storyline.</p>
			<p>I don't think it'd be a spoiler to mention that the main character of the game dies after 22 minutes due to a supernova, or may even die early due to accidents. The death of the character resets the time loop to T-22 minutes before supernova. However, the time loop reset does not wipe off the character's memory of past events, and so the game progress despite the loop rest. <strong>Side-note: second best feature of the game that I really like is this built in stopping point of the character dying and the game restting after that. This prevents my gaming personality from sucking me in the game and spending hours or days in it!</strong> Coming back: I was working on this mission in the game that's kinda hard and tricky, even harder when working with PC controls rather than a gamepad. For those who know about the game, this was on Brittle Hollow and I kept falling in black hole. One wrong move, and you end up wasting a lot more time trying to undo your mistake! The quick solution: just have the character die, reset the time loop, and be more careful the next time.</p>
			<p>Sure there's some metaphysical learning in realization that sometimes in life, one needs to repeat the same work over and over till they find success. However, the game does one better than doling out life lessons that have been identified since ages past. For me, the grand realization was how this game turned the ever fearful notion of death into a cheap trick that is no longer feared! It made me realize that death is feared notion because it causes the body and mind to cease functioning, and with this, there's no way to preserve one's ideas, skills and memory because these are housed within the body and mind. Maybe that's why the natural order is to have offsprings so that one may transfer the ideas, knowledge and skills to the progeny. Maybe this is why burning books is one of the worst attrocities to inflict on a society because it destroys the identity of a being who transcended time via their ideas kept safe in a book. However, in the current digital age, a book is not the only place to collect ideas, there's also the internet! I wonder why this aspect of internet does not get publicity, that is allows everyone within its reach to place their ideas on the platform so that it can survive for eternity (realistically though, not eternity but still a much longer time than books) and with a very low to no entry barrier. Hopefully, we will transcend into a time where more and more people use the opportunity to provide their hard learnt lessons so that everyone else benefits from it; And in doing so, the socity continues to improve and evolve continuously, guided by wisdom of many and not just a few.</p>
			
			<h2 id="what-i-like-part-2">What I like - Part 2</h2>
			<p>Wait.. is this the second best thing I like? Nope, this is not the second best thing that I like about the game. It is still the best thing; both this and the part mentioned above are part of the multi-pronged awesome of the game!</p>
			<p>When the time loop resets, the main character wakes up in the village where it was raised. There are many non active characters in the village. When the game starts for the first time, it is likely you would explore the village and meet many of them, if not all. But what about when the game has started and the time loop resets. Is it such a waste of time to go see them again? Definitely, Yes! :P This is the second realization that I had.. what if someone recently lost someone dear to them, like, a friend, a relative, or immediate family member. What if their voice, their face, lines spoken by them were recorded as one of the character - would you still go back to the village to see them and to hear them speak some different line back to you everytime the time loop resets? Wouldn't it be nice that everytime you go on a mission in the game, then you hear them cheering you and wishing you success? Death is huge emotional loss to everyone not dead, and getting over this loss is an extremely long process with no solution other than waiting it out and hoping that the goodness of the society slowly heals away the pain. I really hope an expansion pack comes up to this game that allows one to record memories of their loved ones, and to revisit it, quite aptly, by resetting time itself.</p>
