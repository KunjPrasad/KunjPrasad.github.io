	<h2>Acknowledgement</h2>
	<p id="1611203333">The work contained herein are derived using both internal and external conversations over the course of my career, while working through multiple challenges. I don't want to undermine my own efforts and contribution, and more than that, I don't want to undermine the contributions of many wonderful people with whom I've had the chance to interact either directly or indirectly (via free content on the web). I am extremely thankful for all the contributions from which I've learnt a lot. If I am able to convey important information, it is only because I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants" target="_blank">stand on the shoulders of giants</a>; if not, then that's my own folly!</p>
