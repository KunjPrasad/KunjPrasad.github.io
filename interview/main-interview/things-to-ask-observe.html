<!--
question to ask interviewer:
-- how do you expect to respond if someone is giving design review and
you point out some issue. Does the company policy require the other
person to hold on proceeding, or is design review not like gatekeeping
but just suggestive in nature.. and others can still do what they want
-- is it needed for managers to also have technical background --
don't ask directly, but somewhat in related manner

..and use those to make questions to ask/ answer points to observe, or as reason for question, or maybe add a "post-interview" chapter where you suggest what one should try to keep in mind after the interview
