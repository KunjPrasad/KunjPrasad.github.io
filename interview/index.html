			<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
			<p id="1634437188">While preparing for software engineering interviews, I felt that it was hard to obtain various resources to prepare for the interview. While some recruiters were kind enough to provide resources to prepare for the interview, these resources generally circled around preparing the candidate (myself) for algorithms and data structures to solve problems. These resources are helpful, but not sufficient to cover various aspects of a software engineering interview. This book is an attempt to collect information/topics that I found useful when preparing for interview, but, I didn't find them mentioned in any books.</p>
			
			<h2 id="personal-notes">Using personal notes</h2>
				<p id="1634316590">Whenever reading any e-book, I've always felt that the ability to add and share my own thoughts is missing; A feature provided by hardcopies of a book wherein notes can be added in page margins. So, in this book, a framework has been added enabling readers to add their own personal notes. The readers are highly encouraged to add their notes, save it for futue use, and also share their notes with others (be careful when accepting notes from others, see <a href="#1634316591">below</a> and <a href="#disclaimer">disclaimer</a>). A note corresponding to a paragraph can be created by clicking on "Add note" button and adding the note text in the empty box that shows up after the button is pressed. By exitting the box, the new/modified note text is automatically saved. If the text in a note box is clered, then the note will get deleted. Multiple notes can be added for an particular paragraph and they'll get sorted by time when the note was created.</p>
				<ul id="1634316591"><strong>WORDS OF CAUTION:</strong>
					<li>If applying someone else's notes, realize that you may be vulnerable to XSS attacks. Use caution and your judgement.</li>
					<li>Your personal notes are not saved on any other server, and are only present on your computer. It is suggested to periodically save a copy of the notes, else you may lose the changes. The loss may happen sooner than latter if you are working on incognito mode. So, please consider saving your work before clearing out browser or closing all incognito tabs.</li>
				</ul>
	
				<h3>Upload notes</h3>
					<p>Click the button below to select a note file from which to read and upload the notes. The newly uploaded notes will merge with the existing notes.</p>
					<button type="button" class="button-utility" onclick="document.getElementById('note-file-upload-input').click();">Upload note file</button>
					<input id="note-file-upload-input" name="note-file-input" type="file" aria-label="Upload note file" style="display: none;" />
	
				<h3>Download notes</h3>
					<p>Click the button below to download notes as a json file. The downloaded note file name starts with prefix <i>"prodBackendDev"</i> to identify that the notes belong to this book. It will also have a numeric timestamp to help identify the time when it was downloaded. Hopefully, this helps in identifying the correct file to be uploaded at a later time.</p>
					<button id="note-file-download-button" type="button" class="button-utility">Download note file</button>
					
				<h3>Clear all notes</h3>
					<p>Click the button below to clear all notes. This action cannot be undone and you will need to upload a notes file again to access notes. If you have unsaved changes, it is suggested to save a copy before clearing all notes. You may want to use this option if, say, you have completed the book, or don't want to proceed with it ..and you want to clear all locally stored data corresponding to this book.</p>
					<div class="alert alert-danger" style="margin:1rem 0">NOTE that this action cannot be undone!</div>
					<button id="remove-note-button" type="button" class="button-utility">Remove all notes</button>
			
			<h2 id="acknowledgment">Acknowledgment</h2>
				<p>The work contained herein are derived using both internal and external conversations over the course of my career, while working through multiple challenges. I don't want to undermine my own efforts and contribution, and more than that, I don't want to undermine the contributions of many wonderful people with whom I've had the chance to interact either directly or indirectly (via free content on the web). I am extremely thankful for all the contributions from which I've learnt a lot. If I am able to convey important information, it is only because I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">stand on the shoulders of giants</a>; if not, then that's my own folly!</p>
