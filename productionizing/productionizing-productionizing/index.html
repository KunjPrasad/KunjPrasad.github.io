			https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-pattern
			
			-- Ethics, transparency.. relation to PII
			--|----  See https://blog.avast.com/why-is-ebay-port-scanning-my-computer-avast and https://nullsweep.com/why-is-this-website-port-scanning-me/ -- don't port scan. If you want to do so for security, then offer as a service and start/stop it when user asks. Don't do so in a hidden cryptic way
			--|---- Don't have/rely on workflow where the website domain changes. Don't have/rely on security where adding a rate limit is part of secuirty logic
			-- Cover different interview HR related questions - not as q&a session.. but by explaining why they exist and what's a good way to go about it
			
			Cover the points below taken from prod-back-end.. but keep generic
			-- Rule of 3 to identify refactor
			-- Foolish consistency is hogoblin
			-- if needed, go for speed, and cover tech debt later. Business first
			
			-- Foolish consistency is hobgoblin -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Reliance  -- do not stifle discussion
			-- Eager optimization -- https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/80084/is-premature-optimization-really-the-root-of-all-evil -- micro management
			
			-- Like software: use must wherever possible
			--|---- example: must have work-life-growth balance. Must not have overwork and burn
			
			-- The Joker: Many self-help articles or book fail to recognize the presence of an absolute absymal entity that cannot be overcome. Think Saturn on steroids. It is just tolerated. You life is miserable for it but you cannot escape. If you haven't had the experience, good for you, and may you never. But don't let that delude into thinking that such entities don't exist. (1) don't ever be such an entity, someone who controls but cannot / does not take a feedback. (2) you never know if someone is coming from under this entity. Give them space to breathe. Show a culture of responsility and transparency and with time, they will emerge. Don't ask someone to change if they are insecure in doing so for a valid reason. If reason is valid, double check if it really is invalid or you think it's invalid. And rather than telling them that it's invalid, give them space and evidence so that they themselves arrive at the conclusion. You can shine a light.. but its presence means a broken system has existed and supported it for so long that it is now a system in itself. Good, if you don't touch it. Better, if you slowly take people away from them so that it turns to a speck with no influence. It is ok if you want to just avoid it and go far from it. Come in the swamps if you want to fight the monster. It is ok if you don't want to because chances are you will get trapped and will sometime in future wonder why you destroyed it all.
			
			-- Don't have a single point of failure
			
			-- Minimalism: People cannot learn more than 2 or 3 points. So, don't give more than that. Any self-help that tries to do so.. I consider that they have not yet explored the depths of relations between different aspects. On that point, keep the book focused around 2-3 points only!! Transparency, Open communication, divergent efficiency (x% in own pod and efficient in own work, and (100-x)% outside pod and efficient knowing of others work). Open communication is the key, and also includes feedback and followup. Transparency is takin responsibility for communication to foster an overall positive movement. Divergence is to promote overall growth
