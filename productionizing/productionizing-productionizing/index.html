			--|----  See https://blog.avast.com/why-is-ebay-port-scanning-my-computer-avast and https://nullsweep.com/why-is-this-website-port-scanning-me/ -- don't port scan. If you want to do so for security, then offer as a service and start/stop it when user asks. Don't do so in a hidden cryptic way
			--|---- Don't have/rely on workflow where the website domain changes. Don't have/rely on security where adding a rate limit is part of secuirty logic
			-- Cover different interview HR related questions - not as q&a session.. but by explaining why they exist and what's a good way to go about it
			
			Cover the points below taken from prod-back-end.. but keep generic
			-- Rule of 3 to identify refactor
			-- Foolish consistency is hogoblin
			-- if needed, go for speed, and cover tech debt later. Business first
			
			-- Foolish consistency is hobgoblin -- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Reliance  -- do not stifle discussion
			-- Eager optimization -- https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/80084/is-premature-optimization-really-the-root-of-all-evil -- micro management
