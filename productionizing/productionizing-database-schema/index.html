			As much possible, always have a unique combination based on data fields.. unless there are some cases where it is not possible: link to part-1/entity in backend-dev

			-- one jira ticket should result in 1 migration. on the migration file, add ticket name and briefly what it does - for easy tracking/identifying. No need to go full detail as git blame can be used to do so
			-- You can change character-set in MySQL columns.. but best to have charset as utf8mb4 — **IMPORTANT**: Not utf8.. in MySQL, utf8 is utf8mb3 (3 bytes of data). Even worse, it can drop string data — MySQL historically set around 767 bytes for indexing. Since most string columns are 255 string size, so MySQL decided that they’ll assign 3 bytes per string. So, if there is a larger data sent.. it gets dropped
			-- Discuss how RDBMS can still store semi-structured data and be denormalized!! What makes NoSQL as NoSQL is that it's a distributed map.
			
			--  Alter table: 2 things to note. Both relate to fact that “Alter table”, when executed, makes copy of original, then changes references to refer to the new table. So:
1) If trying to do multiple “ALTER TABLE” commands, best to collect all of them in a single statement t prevent performance degradation by multiple operations
2) Historically, Alter table would lock the table while alteration is being done. Recent versions have improved it by trying to queue the changes and in the mean time allowing external reads to happen.. but this is still slow!
			
			-- LIMIT command has another form that takes 2 values, 1 is offset and other is the number of entries returned - but under covers this is not performance.. as it first selects everything and then throws offset data out. Better way to paginate is to first filter using WHERE clause, and then use limit.. and then change the input to WHERE for next iteration accordingly.
			
			
			-- SELF-JOIN: table joining on itself. Good for join to get a hierarchy or time-window relation. In this case, for disambiguation, use “AS” clause
			-- See StackOverflow https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3856164/sql-joins-vs-sql-subqueries-performance — in that joins can be faster than sub select
			
			
			1) If you have, say, "N entries" out of which you want only 1 to be active at a time.. then one way is to have say an "active" field that can be true for just one entry. For all others, it should be null. The "null" isn't used in unique and so it behaves as if there's just one active at a time.
			--|---- HOWEVER, it feels like cheating and is not a portable behavior (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20154033/allow-null-in-unique-column). A downside is that if within the group, you want to set an active value to null and some other null value to active, then you'll have to defer consistency till after transaction - which MySQL doesn't allow. So, some restrictions may come - but still, there's workaround.. use 2 transactions - if doing so, set the intermediate value to false, and change it back to null. From application perspective it should still work. Also, for the set of unique values that can be put, try to keep it limited, best if this is done on a boolean field so it can take on true/false value. 
			--|---- Another approach can be to enforce the check using optimistic or pessimistic locking. If using optimistic lock, it may help to have a top level record that defines the version.
			--|---- Use of null valued columns for group uniqueness. BUT, they will cause error if you want to change a different value in group to be true within single transaction.
			
			-- DB unique constraint in design :: Start by adding as strong of a constraint as possible.. relax later if need comes. Don't start with a weak unique constraint (i.e. one based on multiple fields rather than just a single field)
			--|---- Design it with view to enforce uniqueness of created data, hence it solves problem of race condition in creating new data - where DB raises error. 
			--|---- Does this (https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/210949/why-does-this-query-result-in-deadlock) mean that in absence of unique constraint adding / updating 2 entries can cause deadlock!! - another reason to always keep separate numeric id
			
			--storing string, null vs empty
			-- Be careful defining cascade behavior for deletion. safest is always to disable cascade - so that if such a behavior is needed, then application specifically does so
			-- When having db model where lower table has columns that override value of column in a higher table -- then: (1) use column-name in lower table as `{high-column-name}_override` add @property named `{high-column-name}` in lower table that defines the value as using the overriden value if available else using the higher table value.

SQL:
See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24741051/order-by-before-select
-- SQL first selects all data, then orders it.. that's why "order by"
goes after "where" clause.. and that's why just in comparing "order +
limit" to get something going vs using "where".. use "where". Why? -
because SQL needs to get the entire data before it can order it.
reference: http://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/partial-results/top-n-queries
-- related: if you are trying to set some variable for each iteration,
then that will get set before the order is done. So, if you do:
    select t.id, @curRank := @curRank + 1 as rank
    from table t, (SELECT @curRank := 0) r
    order by t.id desc
.. then you won't get @curRank=1 for last t.id. The rank will be 1 for
lowest id, but now the first result will have last id and
correspondingly, highest rank

-- Followup: what happens when no "order" is specified.. don't assume
it will go by "id" as default order. See
https://www.exacthelp.com/2012/10/default-order-of-select-statement-in.html

-- SQL way of getting now number::
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1895110/row-number-in-mysql  ---
IMPORTANT: this can even be used to reset row number for every group
change, you need to use 2 variables, and reset when the value of 2nd
variable (set in past) does not match the column being grouped on
which will be near boundary.. else set the 2nd variable to group
column value
select
    @numWithinGroup := IF(@groupColumnValue = t.group_column,
@numWithinGroup+1, 1) as number_within_group,
    @groupColumnValue := t.group_column /* NOTE: If you do this before
@numWithinGroup update, then the intent of query will fail. Order
matters */
from
    table t,
    (SELECT @numWithinGroup := 0, @groupColumnValue := '') tSupport
order by ?? <-- what order. see previous comment, best to order the
data first before starting this
