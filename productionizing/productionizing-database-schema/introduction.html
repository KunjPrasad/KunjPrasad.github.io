	<h3>What is not covered</h3>
	<ul id="">Following limitations are applied to prevent the book from becoming broad and wordy:
		<li></li> 
	</ul>
	<p id="1609170286">Last, realize that this book is not meant to rationalize breaking away from your team's coding practices. It is instead intended to identify aspects around which to engage in a discussion with the team to generate consensus to slowly bring about a change in coding practices <a href="/productionizing/productionizing-productionizing#1607047888" target="_blank">(more on forming team consensus)</a>.</p> 
	
	<h3>How to proceed</h3>
	<p id="1609174076">This e-book gets referenced as a digression from the <a href="/productionizing/productionizing-backend-development" target="_blank">"Productionizing Backend Development"</a> and so, the scope of this book is limited to discussions within "Productionizing Backend Development" e-book. Readers are suggested to look into "How to proceed" subsection within the <a href="/productionizing/productionizing-backend-development#1606665479" target="_blank">Introduction</a> section of the "Productionizing Backend Development" e-book to get a broader understanding on how one should proceed before wanting to start, or after ending both "Productionizing Backend Development" and this e-book. Specifically though, readers are requested to gain a working knowledge of SQL before starting the book. <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/sql/" target="_blank">This tutorial from W3Schools</a> is a good place to do so.</p>
