	<h2>Custom notes</h2>
	<p id="1607050171">All paragraphs and many other html elements have been given a unique id. When hovering over them, a note icon is displayed that can be clicked to add notes. The goal in doing so is to enable readers to add their own comments. I would highly encourage readers to make their comment file available to other via their own Github repo.</p>
	<p id="1607052126">The notes can also be edited or removed. Multiple notes can be added to an element. Finally, the notes made can be downloaded using the button. When visiting the page another time, use the box below to uplaod the comments file saved from a previous time. <strong>NOTE:</strong> If you navigate away from page after making notes but before saving a copy locally, then those notes will not be saved and will get lost.</p>
	
	<h3>Upload notes</h3>
	<p id="1607053306">Use the box below to select a note file to upload.</p>
	<p id="prod-back-dev-note-upload-status"></p>
	<button onclick="document.getElementById('note-file-input').click();">Upload note file</button>
	<input id="note-file-input" name="note-file-input" type="file" style="display: none;" onchange="uploadPersonalNotes(this.files[0], onNoteUploadSuccess, onNoteUploadError)"/>
	
	<h3>Download notes</h3>
	<p id="1607052366">Click the button below to download notes as a json file. The downloaded note file name starts with prefix <i>"prod-back-dev"</i> to identify that the notes belong to this book. Hopefully, this helps in identifying the correct file to be uploaded at a later time. The downloaded file name also contains a timestamp.</p>
	<button type="button" onclick="downloadPersonalNotes('prodBackendDev')">Download note file</button>
