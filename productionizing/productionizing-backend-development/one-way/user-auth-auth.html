	Link to RBAC. 
	Separate authentication vs authorization. Presence of authentication should not mean authorization
	Stick to RBAC. 
	check authroization on every call, even when reading authentication from JWT. 
	Don't read autheoization / role from JWT since that may be stale
	-- Run-As function: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-run-as-auth   https://blog.marcosbarbero.com/user-impersonation-with-spring-security/
	-- Don't use presence of an auth header for authorization
	-- keep cycling JWT secret. make sure to have retry to handle transition rather than bubble failure up
	-- keep rate limit logic outside controller.. at filter level - because it is a permission. Als, return proper error code (429). Similarly, return proper error code of authentication failure (401) vs authorization fail (403) - unless auth fail happened and user is anonymous.. in which case, raise 401
	--jwt: works in microservice, i..e for service to service communication; also can use if you want to move from one system to other -- but it may be a hassle for users to type long jwt. Can instead use it to form simple one time bearer token
	
	2way: 
	-- auth+entity(user)
	--|---- Constraining users to have a strong password is something that must be done since beginning of application. strong password via multilingual
	--|---- Salting pwd. Don't ask for sensitive data for login
	--|---- ask sensitive data at most once
	
	-- auth + controller
	--|---- if your CORS setting allows having request from different domain (because you are a provider), then need CSRF prevention even on a GET call. If you have a UI then allowing calls only from it can prevent need for CSRF on GET. Still need to tackle it for othr calls.
