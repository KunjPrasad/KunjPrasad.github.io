	<h2>User auth/auth</h2>
	<p id=""></p>
	
	<!--
	
	Do a check on password strength during first time login
	
	session fixation attack; clear session on logout
	
	If possible, have 2factor auth: preferably via app and not by sms
	
	Link to RBAC. 
	Separate authentication vs authorization. Presence of authentication should not mean authorization
	Stick to RBAC. 
	check authroization on every call, even when reading authentication from JWT. 
	Don't read autheoization / role from JWT since that may be stale. always read it again
	-- Run-As function: https://www.baeldung.com/spring-security-run-as-auth   https://blog.marcosbarbero.com/user-impersonation-with-spring-security/
	-- Don't use presence of an auth header for authorization
	-- keep cycling JWT secret. make sure to have retry to handle transition rather than bubble failure up
	-- keep rate limit logic outside controller.. at filter level - because it is a permission. Als, return proper error code (429). Similarly, return proper error code of authentication failure (401) vs authorization fail (403) - unless auth fail happened and user is anonymous.. in which case, raise 401
	
	--jwt: works in microservice, i..e for service to service communication; also can use if you want to move from one system to other -- but it may be a hassle for users to type long jwt. Can instead use it to form simple one time bearer token. JWT ~~> cloud readiness: -- Cloud-readiness: That involves not relying on session. So, authentication via cookie goes out and JWT comes in. Recall that JWT gives client side cloud-readines.. and this applies even if website is interacting with single domain
	
	-- Each request, even from async tasks.. should be as a request from a user. background tasks come as request from system user with a certain correct role. Gives uniformity in handling the task, logging, etc.
	
	-- Don't have/rely on workflow where the website domain changes. This way, if you are changing domain, you can let the user know of it. A common reason do change domain could be to access OAuth token on different server. One reason to prefer this rather than collect user details by yourself and make an internal api call is that latter duplicates the login form code. Best, just let that single service evolve its own code/UI and you just get access to it. Also, since its scope is very limited (just for authentication) - clients should not have issue opening port to it -- given, name the url properly. Like, instead of "login.website.com", say, "openId.website.com"
			-- Don't have/rely on security where adding a rate limit is part of security logic
			-- Don't have/rely on worflow where presence/lack of authentication acts as authorization. If you want to differentiate between, say, 2factor authenticated user vs 1factor authenticated.. then give those 2 different role/permission - even for same principal.
	
	--|---- Even if you have hierarchy in role, its best to treat each role independent and define permission such that the role behaves hierarchical. So, in English, "the role is not hierarchical, but the permission associated to the role is hierarchical"
	
	-- Have a user for system to run async tasks. Use id=1613710989 (referred in 1-way/entity)
			
	-- See 1613946647 in entity. Same reason, don't send role back to user -- because it is a business internal logic.
	
	2way: 
	-- auth+entity(user)
	--|---- Constraining users to have a strong password is something that must be done since beginning of application. strong password via multilingual
	--|---- Salting pwd. Don't ask for sensitive data for login
	--|---- ask sensitive data at most once
	
	(NOTE: below is also covered in repository interaction. In the discussion below, design of DB table is entity interaction.. but actual retrieval is repository interaction)
	--|----|---- Addition to above, in DB, separate out the table, so that the sub-portion that can be accessed by wider role user is a single table and the other restricted role access table is separate, joined to the former via a oneToOne relation.. and defining method preventing object access by other roles. How to define such a method is framework/language specific. This is a valid use case of havig role based security be defined at repository level. This is needed because when the code is running, then the server is one making request to DB to access data.. but it's actually doing it as part of a request triggered by a user. So, we need a mechanism to ensure that the request user is allowed access to a certain DB table. This should also ideally occur for all @OneToOne and @manyToOne ..maybe also for @OneToMany
	-- Sensitive data exposure is a vulnerability. Add extra auditing / controls around sensitive data. Another option is to disallow reads of sensitive data except for admin role:: https://blog.detectify.com/2016/07/01/owasp-top-10-sensitive-data-exposure-6/ -- Maybe move all sensitive data to separate table
			
	
	
	
	-- auth + controller
	--|---- if your CORS setting allows having request from different domain (because you are a provider), then need CSRF prevention even on a GET call. If you have a UI then allowing calls only from it can prevent need for CSRF on GET. Still need to tackle it for othr calls.
	--|---- In most case, CSRF is restricted to attack where an attacking website tricks user to make a request that causes a mutation (in favor of attacker). However, when server returns a response --in these cases-- it will not have CORS' allow all origin header. So, even though a mutation is made, the response of it never goes back to attacker.  HOWEVER consider the case where the server is of a business that is an utility-provider, say, like USPTO. Now, server can and should expect that different domains will be calling it - and so, it now needs to set CORS header to allow all origin. But this opens up a different problem in that even for non-mutating calls (GET call), the attacker can now see sensitive user data - and the webpage won't restrict it because CORS is effectively disabled. In such cases, it is necessary to have CSRF protection even on GET calls. 
	--|---- **VERY VERY IMPORTANT** The advantage of JWT comes here in that JWT created by one can be used by other.. token can be passed on front-end.. back-end.. etc. As long as token passes, the authentication continues and there's no need to worry of CSRF token. 
	--|----|---- RELATED: https://engineering.mixmax.com/blog/modern-csrf/
	
	--|---- (may be done in user-auth-auth 1way; or 2way auth+controller) If you also give an UI.. To prevent phishing, allow users to set an initial profile token that is showed when they log in. And allow this only on request coming from your UI domain (also adding for UI). This also tells user that they are the one logging in ..and they logged in for first time, then they see that they're loggin in for the first time. If doing so, remember to not ask for any PII when setting this value
	
	
	2way (auth + controller) : Security: rate limit on sign on failure
	
	
	3way: auth + user+code-arrangement:
	--|---- Corresponding to the role, define a user profile such that it can be foreign key'd to by models exposed via views permitted to the role. If you have some common details to know from all user (like a base-profile), then just add those in your definition of "user" table. Have the profile based data be very specific to role. BUT.. when a "Group" is defined, it only defines Role (of RBAC) and not the profile. So, need a table to define "RoledProfile" for a user based on user-group (aka, user-role). This creates few more complications.. what happens if user changes roles. There may be model entries elsewhere in DB that refer to user profile.. but the old profile no longer remains. In such cases, it is better to instead never delete a profile and just soft-delete it. This prevent model relations from getting broken, keeps audit trail. This also means that when user changes role, they must also create a new profile and permissions must now be defined such that it looks both into role and whether the new profile is present and is active. A third question can be what happens if user changes profile back and forth -- and this relates to defining the unique constraint in the roledProfile table.
			--|----|---- One good thing about thinking in terms of "Profile" and RBAC rather than "user" is now you can think of how TAKE/SNITIZE request on all other DB tables look like for each "profile". Also, (profile + rbac) define permissions
