	<h2>What does "1-way interaction" mean?</h2>
	<p id="1609471444">This section of the book discussed different terms relating to handling of request on server side. Why are these not put in glossary? - Because I want these terms to be covered in more depth as compared to other glossary items. After all, this book is about backend development and these terms form the backbone for backend development. The use of term "1-way interaction", in itself, is confusing (Sorry!!). However, it was chosen to keep be in line with the subsequent sections of the e-book which cover interaction between 2 or more request handling related terms and how it bring in a design concern that should be kept in mind when coding for backend software. Such interactions are covered under sections titled "2-way interaction", "3-way interaction", etc. depending on the count of terms interacting with each other and giving rise to corresponding design concerns.</p>
	
	<h3>About this section</h3>
	<p id="1609600268">With all infrastructure and code repository set up, along with necessary code to get a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program" target="_blank">"Hello World"</a> web application working (i.e., you have a endpoint such that calling it return "Hello World" text), it's time to star with business related backend development. It starts by the business side providing a list of features that are needed. Since the business application will be receiving data from various users, it becomes necessary to identify how the business wants to model the data and corresponding relations, and store it in database as tables. An <a href="#1609472905" data-nav-id="1609472905">entity</a> is the code equivalent of the database tables. The process of identifying different database tables also helps clarify how the business expects its interactions with the users/customers and vice versa. Two more design aspects gets finalized from this discussion: the structure of <a href="#1608993702" data-nav-id="1608303678">request urls</a> and corresponding <a href="#1609036000" data-nav-id="1608303678">request methods</a> that the backend application must support, and, the structure of <a href="#1609036000" data-nav-id="1609041974">request and response data</a> that is exhanged with a particular request url. Details about the request url and method is covered under <a href="#1609472915" data-nav-id="1609472915">controller</a>. Details about the exchanged data is covered under <a href="#1609472910" data-nav-id="1609472910">data transfer object, or DTO</a>. At this point, the interaction between the business application and the user/customer has been wired, and so we need to focus on specific business task that gets performed when the request is made. This is done by the <a href="#1609472920" data-nav-id="1609472920">service</a> method. In performing the task, the service method may need to read a entry from database table, which it does by invoking a <a href="#1609472930" data-nav-id="1609472930">repository</a> method. There can be other interactions between service and repository methods which will be discussed in the e-book when appropriate.</p>
	<p id="1609604528">In addition to above, there are other features that are used. If a function needs to happen before / after / both before and after every request-call is handled, then a <a href="#1609472935" data-nav-id="1609472935">filter</a> can be used. A <a href="#1609472940" data-nav-id="1609472940">rendererer</a> helps in converting response DTO object into a form as desired by the user. An <a href="#1609472945" data-nav-id="1609472945">exception handler</a> makes it easy to handle unexpected calls, like, make with wrong/missing values, or trying to access someone else's data. <a href="#1609472950" data-nav-id="1609472950">User auth/auth</a> covers user authentication and authorization. It also ensures that a user is not allowed access to certain service, for example, the ones reserved for admin. A <a href="#1609472955" data-nav-id="1609472955">feature flag</a> allows controlling whether a feature should be opened to users or not. This can be helpful in initial stages of feature development when the development team is rolling out partial implementations of a new feature and so they don't want anyone accessing it. Sometimes it may be needed or just beneficial to have values stored "somewhere" that can be accessed as needed anywhere in the entire request processing chain. These are <a href="#1609472960" data-nav-id="1609472960">custom request attributes</a>. In addition to above, there are some more terms that relate to request processing which are discussed <a href="#1609385771" data-nav-id="1609385771">here</a>.</p>
	
	<h3>Words of caution</h3>
	<ul id="1609604638">A few words of caution:
		<li><strong>Recall that in addition to above terms, there are additional terms mentioned in glossary that one must keep in consideration when developing backend application.</strong></li>
		<li><strong>Realize that in getting a business application ready, above steps may get repeated multiple times.</strong> Above it not meant to convey that it happens just once. There may also be other concerns specific to the business application being developed.</li>
