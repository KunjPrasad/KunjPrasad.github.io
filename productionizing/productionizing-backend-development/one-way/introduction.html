	<h2>What does "1-way interaction" mean?</h2>
	<p id="1609471444">This section of the book discussed different terms relating to handling of request on server side. Even when defining the terms, I want these terms to have more space and be covered in more depth as compared to other glossary items. After all, this book is about backend development and these terms form the backbone for backend development. The use of term "1-way interaction", in itself, is confusing (Sorry!!). However, it was chosen to keep be in line with the subsequent sections of the e-book which cover interaction between 2 or more request handling related terms and how it bring in a design concern that should be kept in mind when coding for backend software. Such interactions are covered under sections titled "2-way interaction", "3-way interaction", etc. depending on the count of terms interacting with each other and giving rise to corresponding design concerns.</p>
