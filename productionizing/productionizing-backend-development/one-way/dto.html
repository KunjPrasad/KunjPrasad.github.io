	<h2>Data transfer object, or DTO</h2>
	<p id="1609600136"></p>
	
	
	<!--
	-- Keep diffrent from model because requirement on how display/transfer data may change even for same underlying table structure.. or vice versa. Also entity needs to be normalized, but DTO can be denormalized
	
	Not converting from body text to map.. but from map to object ..and vice versa
	Different from entity - because S of SOLID
	-- dto security: add file size limit, list size limit, string text size limit, only certain string text characters allowed
	-- Always virus check a downloaded file. If possible, also do a magic check
	-- Always sanitize html. Even better get it as markup
	
	-- Neve contain id, only slug
	
	
	2-way:
	-- Mostly similar to Entity but can be slightly different. How to prevent unnecessar code duplication - one way could be to use a framework that simplifies DTO construction from model while also giving flexibility to change (example DRF's ModelSerializer), and also flexibility to make totally different DTO is needed. Don't just extend model to form dto as that creates tight coupling.
	-- dto and user role: serialize / deserialize based on user role
