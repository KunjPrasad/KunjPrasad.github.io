	<!--
	
	Not converting from body text to map.. but from map to object ..and vice versa
	
	Different from entity - because S of SOLID
	
	Mostly similar to Entity but can be slightly different. How to prevent unnecessar code duplication - one way could be to use a framework that simplifies DTO construction from model while also giving flexibility to change (example DRF's ModelSerializer), and also flexibility to make totally different DTO is needed. Don't just extend model to form dto as that creates tight coupling.
