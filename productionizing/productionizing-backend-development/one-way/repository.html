	<!--
	-- Repository layer -- use it to add abstraction on data retrieval.. like, either using cache or DB, or saving file via different scheme (uri or http), or saving on local drives or saving in cloud
			--|---- If adding cache, ensure that you are updating cache and backend both.. do proper integration and functional testing
			
	-- database connection password change. Make sure to add retries so the transition is handled smoothly and not fails which is then pushed to service
	
	
	a RESTful controller can be used as a repository by end user (CQRS) - in a microservice architecture
	
	
	
	-- one application should own 1 DB and also "vice versa". Keep one-one ownership and interaction with other business sub-pieces via REST call, using org-wide JWT for authentication
	--|---- Best practice is to have one application interact with one DB. Don't have many applications interact with one DB. instead require  from other applications that they make an API call to one of them to get the response. Similarly, while it is possible for one application to interact with multiple DB.. it is best to instead break those to smaller-applications and maintain one-DB--one-application relation. This allows for better data modeling and separation. How should the other applications deal with service outage is something that is best discussed and identified.
	
	-- If you want to define a method like : <Entity> getByUnique(arg1, arg2, ..) -- how should it be defined when table changed and a new column added that should add to unique combo: (1) add new column and with value while keeping default on original args; in same commit also modify repo method to include new column. (2) make new entries, modify unique criteria and do 2nd migration
	
	
	-- Always use "order by" when querying for data - else DB can have weird behavior -- add in repository! what happens when no "order" is specified.. don't assume it will go by "id" as default order. See https://www.exacthelp.com/2012/10/default-order-of-select-statement-in.html
	--|---- Some frameworks provide features to pull all related data in a many-to-many relation. For such features.. use it only if it possible to control the order of results in join table
	
	
	2way (repo + repo)
	querying multiple places before returning data (gatherer)
	-- Use id=1615299781: CQRS (relate to CQRS in one-way/entity>>1615177377)
	-- Use CQRS if reads are much heavy than writes. sending data from write to read repo can be done sync or async and can create related performance issues / behaviors when quick read operation is done after write. But if that's ok.. then CQRS can be considered.
	-- Another example is moving low use data to different repo. For example, run a task every week to take all audit entries beyond, say, 3 months and push them to a different storage. For the records in DB, you can run background processing. Now, if a rare call comes to get old data.. first cehck in DB and data not found, so go in other storage to get data.
	
	--|----- 3way (controller + repo + repo)
	If you doing data gather from multiple sources, maybe look into adding request headers to prevent making api if the gathered data will not be used by user. This adds performance by not making unwanted api calls (or, use GraphQL on front end.)
	
	
	
	2way (Repo +Repo)
	-- repository - syncing between multiple repos using Transactional outbox; or use log + periodic task. Since Transactional outbox doesn't have unique fields.. means.. can also use message queue  -- see 1613747301 in one-way/entity. Be careful in designing transactional outbox.. it can create multiple messages per task. You api should be able to process messages once andnot multiply.
	
	--|---- corresponding 3way (model+repo+repo) ~~> File storage
	-- explain why file is not saved in DB?
	-- can also include Fao, or message, or multi repos calls. The goal is to be able to properly handle file storage without junk
	-- move old file and old data to different database/filesystem.
	-- do filesystem related changes before calling database.  Ideally your fao should be able to take binary data, a location.. and be able to store binary data such that given a location - it gives that binary data back. 1st task entry in DB: That you're about the create file. If this entry remains for say 1 hour, then delete file if existing - close transaction. If code fails now, the task exists to delete junk file - if existing. Then upload file at location. Then make DB changes in transacion. And also, remove the pending task entry made earlier. If the transaction fails, file will be deleted.
	-- since file is saved in filesystem.. so DB should store only a filename, a token path (not related to filename) but that should be given to filesystem or fao to get the file. Use of scheme to use same file token but in different ways. Additinal file metadata - like hash, or length, etc.
	-- don't put file min/max size or virus check validation -- because that's a web service level constraint.. and so should come on DTO .. not at model
	
	
	
	
	2way (Model-Repository)
	-- store sensitive model data as encrypted. Keep changing this encryption key (different from DB connection pwd). When changing encrypion key, update all stored data. Have fallback logic to gracefully retry during transition.
	--|---- consider using a framework, or adding a tempate yourself to help support aspect oriented design along database calls. This can be useful for audit tracking. 
	--|---- (3way)..Although it can also be used for object level security - don't do so.. instead expose methods via controller and always interact with application by user, even for system calls
	
	
	
	
	2way (Repository-Repository)
	-- Discuss "select for update" vs "optimistic locking"
			--|--- As part of better understanding: understand isolation levels: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4034976/difference-between-read-commited-and-repeatable-read#:~:text=Repeatable%20read%20is%20a%20higher,unchanged%2C%20and%20available%20to%20read.
			--|---- Above link : https://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/210949/why-does-this-query-result-in-deadlock - Particularly, interesting is observation that even if one is doing create/update in single transaction - that can cause deadlock! Sure, it should have used better uniqueness constraints.. but over here, "select-for-update" works but the optimistic locking won't help!!
			--|---- Update calls can be done pessimistically or optimistically: See https://medium.com/@hakibenita/how-to-manage-concurrency-in-django-models-b240fed4ee2  REALIZE that: 
			--|----|---- (i) pessimistic calls using "select_for_update", even if it works - does not guarantee that data won't be overwritten. For example: User-1 reads data-version-0, and updates to new-value-v11. User-2 concurrently reads data-version-0, but updates to value-v12. If not done properly, select_for_update will just guarantee that the 2 updates happen one after another, which means it can go in any manner. One can set "nowait=True" so an exception is returned.. still, it does not guarantee the order of updates -- meaning, maybe User-2 updated to value-v12 just because he saw v0 to begin with. If he saw v11 (from user-1), maybe user-2 would have put something else. 
			--|----|---- (ii) For above reason, and because it is easier.. using Optimistic locking is better. However, realize that doing so means you'll have to do 2 reads. The "medium.com" example above shows as if its doing just 1 call.. but in order to pass "self.version" in get() call, it'll first have to query db to get recent version. Another option -- get "version" to use as a hidden param (in form), or as a header, or as query param. BECAUSE -- thinking again of UX.. when user makes an update.. they are doing so based on some data - so it must be communicated back to server about what data they were using. [[Instead of version, one may also seek to use timestamp]]
			--|---- ABOUT "SELECT FOR UPDATE":
			--|----|---- As mentioned above, this still cannot solve unintended overwrites!! - For that, need optimistic locking / versioning
			--|----|---- Django doc: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/ref/models/querysets/#select-for-update
			--|----|----|----- **VERY VERY IMPORTANT**: NOTE: it says that if queryset has select_related(), then those rows are also locked! This in itself could be a good feature for certain use cases.. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10935850/when-to-use-select-for-update
			--|----|---- See https://www.brightbox.com/blog/2013/10/31/on-mysql-locks/ for different locks that can happen. THUS, when using "select_for_update", best restrict yourself ONLY to lookup by "id" only - so that you just do row level locks
			--|---- A UX problem with optimistic locking is that if it fails, end user will get a message to fill form again that can be frustrating. Sure, UI can be improved.. but better still, wraps optimistic failures in retry logic. Also, related question - just to prevent user annoyance, do you want them to mistakenly overwrite someone else's data. Plus, UI frameworks can save form-data if the call is unsuccessful.. you can return HTTP 409. so why not?!
			--|----  If using optimistic lock, and operation can touch multiple rows in some sub-table, then it may help to have a top level record that defines the version.
			--|---- To mention/clarify again: select_for_update is best done when you want to lock a table during update. For example, say you only want certain column to have sequential numbers. The way to getting it would be to get the current table size and use it to get next number. Thus, synchronization is inherently needed and using optimistic locking only may not be helpful - because in creating new row, it'll have a version of 0. And you're not modifying old entry's version.. so optimistic lock will end up creating overwritten entries.. but not so if done using select_for_update
			--|----|---- ALSO.. If your object has a lot of concurrent updates you are probably better off with the pessimistic approach. If you have updates happening outside the ORM (for example, directly in the database) the pessimistic approach is safer. If your method has side effects such as remote API calls or OS calls make sure they are safe (Taken from https://hakibenita.com/how-to-manage-concurrency-in-django-models)
			--|---- **IMPORTANT**: Optimistic Locking is particularly good/useful for cases where partial update of row cannot be done. Thus the row completely updates in each operation. In such cases, row-versioning in optimistic locks prevent update on an old version of data. Note that optimistic locks are good to use when there is a low write/concurrent-update rate. Also, having this paradigm requires both an understanding from client and server side. Client must understand that they're trying to update a "version" data and that the operation can fail in which case they'll need to retry. However, depending on use-case server side may add some retry logic. On the other hand, select for update pauses the execution rather than causing failures like optimistic locks - so it is good for high write rate. Implementing optimistic locking is not available out of box so it needs extra coding work. RELATED: (i) Realize that model.save() can have additional referential checks before data is saved. Those checks get bypassed if using queryset.update() used for optimistic locking; (ii) since queryset.update() is getting invoked, then model's save() signal will not get invoked; (iii) save() method has an argument "update_fields" that can additionally be used for performance gains and to enable concurrent update of different portions of model. This feature can be used instead of update() for optimistic locking. **ALSO** don't worry about optimistic/pessimistic lock unless you're starting to see db contention.



	
	2way: repository (fao) + security: 
	-- file vulnerabilities: If you take a file-path param from user. Appication goes there and picks up file
			--|---- abuse#1: use file-system pathway, like starting with ~, or ../../ - to go to other directories -- Best don't ask filepath from user. They should just be giving some filename and application should be able to identify path and use it
			--|---- abuse#2: use filename like http://server.com/some-path - force application to do http call and download some bug, etc. - This means, that for all internal call between system to system.. always use JWT and a user. If using external  file pickup, then use oAuth. 
			
			
			
			
	2way: repository+security
	(NOTE: below is also covered in repository interaction. In the discussion below, design of DB table is entity interaction.. but actual retrieval is repository interaction)
	--|----|---- Addition to above, in DB, separate out the table, so that the sub-portion that can be accessed by wider role user is a single table and the other restricted role access table is separate, joined to the former via a oneToOne relation.. and defining method preventing object access by other roles. How to define such a method is framework/language specific. This is a valid use case of havig role based security be defined at repository level. This is needed because when the code is running, then the server is one making request to DB to access data.. but it's actually doing it as part of a request triggered by a user. So, we need a mechanism to ensure that the request user is allowed access to a certain DB table. This should also ideally occur for all @OneToOne and @manyToOne ..maybe also for @OneToMany
	-- Sensitive data exposure is a vulnerability. Add extra auditing / controls around sensitive data. Another option is to disallow reads of sensitive data except for admin role:: https://blog.detectify.com/2016/07/01/owasp-top-10-sensitive-data-exposure-6/ -- Maybe move all sensitive data to separate table
	
	-- SSRF (Server side request forgery) -- force a server to make request to unintended destination. This is bad because it breaks the trust in server. If there is any place in request-body or request-param where it is taking a url, that's bad. Can try putting in code in docx, pdf if you know it's going to get parsed/transformed and that can cause a hit on attacker webpage
	
	--|----|---- When storing user-uploaded file, make sure they never get the "Executable" permission, even by self. Be very very careful if your workflow requires you to process files. Have it done somewhere else. Maybe also put upload size restriction; rate-limit based on ip / user-role-type; do virus scan. Wonder if a good thing would be to always encrypt file on disk - both for data security, plus the file gets jumbled so cannot execute. When storing user-file, never make the file-extension visible, instead have it only be in DB. Maybe also randomly chunk the file so it never makes sense on own (do so after encrypting entire file) -- do note that if you're accepting chunked files, then do a virus scan on combined files before continuing
	--|----|---- Use "magic" to inspect file-headers. For example: python has https://github.com/ahupp/python-magic
	--|----|---- Above (i.e. do workflow processing somewhere else) also relates to why dto should always have fixed structure (see billion laugh attack) referred under dto
	
	
	
	
	2way: repository + controller
	-- IDOR (insecure direct object reference) -- example can be checking parent child relation in REST call -- This is also a reason to use slug, and then define them in a random manner and not by joining fields because doing latter would make it guessable!
