	<h2>Entity</h2>
	<p id="1610064998">In current times, an application capable of supporting a business must be able to interact with individual customer and provide services needed by them individually. Serving same set pf data to everyone and everytime (..like this ebook) can't grow as a business because it ignores individual needs of someone willing to pay for the service. Thus, it is necessary to have a "data-repository" where user data and relations between difference data pieces can be saved. For a small dataset, this can be done in memory, but that data will get lost on a power outage. Persisting it on disk is necessary to be able to store data long term and to only keep a small subset of working data in memory. A <a href="#1608527531" data-nav-id="1608344368">database</a> can be used to store data and corresponding data relations on disk. In current software landscape, it is very likely that an <a href="#1609290898" data-nav-id="1608344385">object-oriented paradigm</a> will be used for backend development. In this paradigm, the data for a certain feature maps to object of corresponding class. This object, linked to a business process, is Entity (also see <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2550197/whats-the-difference-between-entity-and-class" target="_blank">this question on StackOverflow</a>).</p>
	<p id="1610065766">For completeness, it should be realized that one is free to construct database tables in a manner that they don't map to classes used in the program. However, doing so adds a friction in being able to push-data-to/pull-data-from the database and use it in the application. An <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object%E2%80%93relational_mapping" target="_blank">Object-relational mapping (or ORM)</a> is a programming technique for converting data between incompatible systems so that there is a frictionless flow of data back and forth between the application and database. When working on a backend application, it is always preferable to have a database and framework with ORM support. <strong>For purpose of this ebook, it is assumed that the backend application is developed using a programming language and a framework that provides ORM support.</strong></p>
	<p id="1610065800">A better understanding of "entity" also requires keeping database related considerations in mind. This is done in a separate ebook: <a href="/productionizing/productionizing-database-schema" target="_blank">Productionizing Database Schema</a>. Readers are suggested to refer it after finishing this e-book. This book covers design considerations that go in design of entity and does not need an understanding of realizing those designs in database.</p>
