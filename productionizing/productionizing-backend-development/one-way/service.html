	<h2>Service</h2>
	<p id="">Acknowledge that the terminology is Java focused - it means portions of code wth business logic. Couples to controller and repository only. may couple to other service methods.
	
	<!--
	This is where business logic starts. Do business dependent validation.
	service code must be as much declarative in nature. 
	Retry logic: -- Making a unified client; Ambassador pattern
	
	
	
	2way:
	dto and service: do validation first and fail fast. 
	
	
	2way: service+security
	-- doing any file processing in different server with stricter security
	
	
	2way service+test
	-- create mock for 3rd party api and background tasks and integration test it
	
	
	3way: service + transaction (2way)
	Handle one type of DB or file or MQ call per service. This allows having @transaction. For file / MQ processing, the corresponding service shouldn't have @transaction
	--|----|---- Above is an example of interaction with multiple data store. In such cases, always have a background sync / clenup process. Also design your code to be able to do so. Use Transactional outbox pattern.. or if your code is in initial or non-complex stages, then just a logging with a periodic check might also suffice.
