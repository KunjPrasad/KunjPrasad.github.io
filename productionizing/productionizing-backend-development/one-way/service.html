	<h2>Service</h2>
	<p id="">Acknowledge that the terminology is Java focused - it means portions of code wth business logic. Couples to controller and repository only. may couple to other service methods.
	
	This is where business logic starts. Do business dependent validation. keep declerative
	
	<!--
	-- service code must be as much declarative in nature. 
	Retry logic: -- Making a unified client; Ambassador pattern
	
	2way:
	dto and service: do validation first and fail fast.
