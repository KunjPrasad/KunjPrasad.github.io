	<h2>Additional terms</h2>
	<p>This page lists the various terms that relate to request handling but will not be used in future sections. Like the glossary items, it is good to know about them and what they do. However, it is very unlikely that they will be modified when developing custom backend code, and so, they don't cause any design concerns via a "n-way interaction" that must be kept in mind when coding.</p>
	
	<h3>Syncronous vs asynchronous request handling</h3>
	<p id="">
	This is not async made in JS, or async inside the code.. but async when initiating request processing by server.  
	ASGI decomposes protocols into a series of events that an application must receive and react to, and events the application might send in response. For HTTP, this is as simple as receiving two events in order - http.request and http.disconnect, and sending the corresponding event messages back. For something like a WebSocket, it could be more like receiving websocket.connect, sending a websocket.send, receiving a websocket.receive, and finally receiving a websocket.disconnect. Because these messages could be sent over a network, they need to be serializable.

	<h3>Request resolver</h3>
	<p id="">https://docs.oracle.com/javaee/6/api/javax/servlet/RequestDispatcher.html</p>
	
	<h3>Request session</h3>
	<p id="">Cloud readiness. interaction with JWT. Needs session stickiness configured and/or a distributed cache</p>
	
	<h3>Internationalization</h3>
	<p id=""></p>
	
	<h3>Buffered vs Steam response</h3>
	<p id="">buffered vs stream vs frame response: how it makes from client to server and from server to client ..and how it links to connection timeouts</p>
	
	<h3>Testing web services</h3>
	<p id="">Unit vs Functional vs Integration. Unit goes over public methods of controller, service, repository. Functional goes over controller endpoint - request and response. Integration is combination of functional. Why even have unit -- to test side effects that may otherwise be hard to test, like async tasks spawned; Or to ensure that a certain side effect is done by a particular layer only - this enforces design.
	Add unit test in proper folder name. For functinal test, there's no reason to have it in same folder name as a DTO or Controller etc. BUT, best to give it same package name as controller since functional test runs starting with controller invocation. For integration test, give it business process specific folder name</p>
	
	<h4>Validation error</h4>
	<p id="">-- The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP 14 RFC2119 RFC8174 when, and only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</p>
