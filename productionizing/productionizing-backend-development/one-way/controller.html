	<h2>Controller</h2>
	<p id=""></p>
	
	<!--
	
	Includes URL also
	
	Realize -- and mention that a RESTful controller can be used as a repository by end user (CQRS) - in a microservice architecture
	
	Acknowledge that the terminology is Java focused - it means portions of code that interact with request and no more. Controller, in MVC does more and we'll come to it later. Converting request body text to object comes here. 
	
	Or maybe this should be a 2-way interaction concern You need a validated DTO before sending to service. The problem is coming in whether validation should be as part of DTO construction or otherwise. Since validation being done are as part of field definition, it can be done as part of constructor.. but not sure if that'll raise error in proper way. The framework may require a specific way.. so that makes it a 2-way interaction. ~~> Concern: only do request level appropriate validation, like, if you were expecting list, did you get it or get string. Did you get generic string or only containing a-z,A-Z,0-9, etc. NOTE: Only do validations related to field definitions and no relation with underlying business process or entity involved. Like, you can say that an integer value holding hours of day must be between 0-23 only. But don't assert that it is between 9am-5pm, etc. Can still do multi field validation only if the current form is transformable to new form in which constraints apply. For example, let's say you are collecting start and end time. Other way to represent it could be start time and duration. since duration less than 0 does not make sense, so one can think of having start time less than end time as constraint. But, no business specific ones.. like the difference between two must be certain period, etc.
	
	controller should be even less code, just validating data and passing to service.
	
	-- separate and specific url for a RPC action -- conforms to "I of solid. -- interface segregation ..better understanding for a client of what they are doing with minimal processing magic which manifests itself as less if-else branch on view side.
	
	-- stick to http spec of keeping GET as a safe method, and of having PUT, GET, DELETE as idempotent. See here: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/idempotent -- For this reason, never make "delete last entry" as a delete call because it is not idempotent. If it can change, then instead use POST and model it as a RPC call -- done via POSTING of a message that is then picked up and processed
	
	--Just like "Location" is valid response header.. so can use Response header for pagnations response. But don't send page number request via header - that must be via queryParam: https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/289044/rest-api-paging-via-headers    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12168624/pagination-response-payload-from-a-restful-api    
	
	-- at least aspire to level 2 REST
	--|---- use proper response code
	
	-- Understand and use the http-cache directive, particularly for subset of url serving static data (like those from standard table)
	
	
	-- Add basic security response headers:: https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/site/docs/5.0.x/reference/html/headers.html
	Configure Content security policy
	Configure allowed hosts is possible
	
	
	
	
	--|---- Make sperate url for different model=state-related or business-related specific actions.. rather than grouping them under 1 generic path that then adds a bunch of if-else!! Former is clearer to understand, better logging, better understanding of user intent by just looking at url. Related: See https://restful-api-design.readthedocs.io/en/latest/methods.html -- REST is generally about resources and CRUD operations on it. But sometimes, we may want to do some function on a resource. This article suggests that such operations should always be POST because they can be thought of as POSTing request to a message queue asking for an operation to get done.  Since every such messages are different, so it becomes a POST request. HOWEVER, I feel it can also be made as a PUT or PATCH if the operation is idempotent in nature.. or only causes partial changes.
			--|---- For single item url, do not add query param. It is weird to have a single item slug and then also a filter. If you feel the need to do so, then ask if the item that needs to be sent is buisness logic dependent or not. If yes, you want to send it in request body. If not, then send it in header. **This is a good way to see when to add field to request body, or query param or header
			
	--|---- At any point, if you're returning a list that is unbounded, either as sub-field when doing a GET one object call, or if making a list call - that is not a good design. A good design always filters in some way or other to prevent sending unbounded list. Speaking generally, returning unbounded list at any point just tells that the design isn't hashed out on what to do once the list is obtained. Sending an unbounded list is giving a view of entire DB and that is not a good thing to do. Maybe at start.. but not for long term. Consider adding search and pagination. Also whenever returning, consider adding a default sort
			
	--|---- Using header, path param vs query param - think of it like directory. An advantage of using path param is that the parent/child relation is explicit -- having entries in query param don't make the parent child relation explicit; Query param good to present a search like behavior in flat list of items. On other hand, there may be contextual reasons to not add parent param in url path because that is unique (for user of certain role) and can be removed. Or, what if you want child resource but want to filter on multiple parent-id (matrix param is alternative, but that can get involved - can be at non terminal locations, see https://www.baeldung.com/spring-mvc-matrix-variables)  Related: see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9169081/rest-apis-custom-http-headers-vs-url-parameters
			--|---- Realize that url with patha nd quer param gets bookmarked, but header is not saved. So, anything not related to respource but more on resource negotiation or authentication should be in header
			--|---- See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/389169/best-practices-for-api-versioning -- for URL versioning
			
	
	The url can be denormalized (to capture context) - but that doesn't mean that the backend is denormalized.. backend can still be normalized if that's the use case
			
	
	
	2way: controlle+entity
	--|---- Let's say you are dealing with a child resource under a parent resource. There are 2 ways to proceed in terms of URL:
			Option-1: "/root/parent/{parentSlug}" and "/root/parent/{parentSlug}/child/{childSlug}", or,
			Option-2: "root/parent/{parentSlug}" and "/root/child/{childSlug}".
			When to use one vs another vs maybe-both:
			--|----|---- First, remember to be flexible.. the decision you come to is very dependent on your application needs. Both cases hold their own merit.
			--|----|---- One difference is that when creating new child, first option will call "POST /root/parent/{parentSlug}/child" and second will call "POST /root/child". First must read parentSlug from url and not from request body, and second must read {parentSlug} from request body since none is available in url. If using 2nd, don't pass a filter-param to pass parentSlug.
			--|----|---- first option is suited if you will only query for a child after having gotten the parent and so you want to keep a referential integrity. Second is lax on that.. an attacker only needs to know the childSlug to get the resource. Note that this concern only holds during GET call. For POST, PUT, PATCH, and even DELETE, you can require a request-body with parentSlug in it.
			--|----|---- If using 2nd option, you can query for child resource from multiple parent resource at once, like, "GET /root/child?parent=slug1,slug2,slug3" (but can also use matrix params)
			--|---- If getting a child resource must always come with some implicit understanding of parentSlug, then Option-2 is better. Like, get child-resources for most-recent/active parent resource. Then "GET /root/child" would work but not first option until the parent slug is obtained via separate query. THAT BEING SAID.. even for second option, use something like "GET /root/child?parent=active" -- This leaves "GET /root/child" as idempotent in that it gives all child resources. The "parent=active" filter now says to get only most active parent. This way, different filters can be made for different use case. Maybe.. define your HATEOAS response to show different url based on different role!!!
	
			
	
	2way: controller + exception handler
	--|---- Ref checks and failures. Consider: GET /root/grandResource/{grandId}/parentResource/{parentId}/childResource/{childId}
			--|----|---- Without the final {childId} and if it's a GET call, then return 404 because the url should not exist. What about instead returning 200 with empty list.. I think it's not very REST like, because if reference checks failed, say, between {grandId} and {parentId}, then how did the list type url for child even get formed? It like saying "GET /root/grandResource/{grandId}/parentResource/{parentId}" is 404, but "GET /root/grandResource/{grandId}/parentResource/{parentId}/childResource" is 200 with empty list?!
			--|----|---- Without the {childId} and if it's a POST call, then, return a 404 if reference check fail in url. Note how this matches with above: Now, it won't even be the case that "GET /root/grandResource/{grandId}/parentResource/{parentId}/childResource" gives 200 with empty list but "POST /root/grandResource/{grandId}/parentResource/{parentId}/childResource" gives 404!!
			--|----|----|---- If reference check fails in the request object, then corresponding field should raise error and there be a 400 status.
			--|----|---- With the {childId} and if it's a GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE call, then return empty list on reference check fail and 404 status
	

			-- be careful not to leak status by error: Say you got "GET /root/a/{aId}/b" for some other criteria given in header or query param, and there's no match. A good answer could be to return [] with 200 status, saying - we don't want to tell you whether you're breaking any relation or not.. but hey, ythere's nothing matching. Similarly, "GET /root/a/{aId}/b/{bId} now returns 404". What if you do "POST /root/a/{aId}/b" and some header value or query param, but those don't hold reference relation with {aId}.. do you give 404? - can't because if you turn POST to GET, then resource exists and is [].. we just did above. Maybe you do a 400 saying that some value is not available - and rule become that anything 404 type in POST request gets returned with 400 instead. What if both reference relation don't hold and you don't have permission because you belong to {a2Id} not {aId}.. if the service instead returns just verifies your role but not your relation with {aId} as missing and you give some different error, then you leak information of relation. The thing to realize: First authenticate and authorize user, then check validity of url (or raise 404), then check relation between all other user/header data and url and raise 404 again (not 401 or 403) because other data provide additional context around user and so must be verified to form full "definition" of "user". Finally now, go to other status like 400, etc.
			--|---- Expanding further on above:consider url like: /root/a/{aId}
			--|----|---- realize that in sense of usage, the user would have done the following sequence of operations: /root, /root/a, /root/a/{aId}, /root/a/{aId}/b, /root/a/{aId}/b/{bId}. 
			--|----|---- /root wouldbe open to all users since it gives general info. 
			--|----|---- /root/a?{queryParams} - can also be opened to all users because there is no user and url link (..because there is no path param yet). It should return 200 with empty list if there's no data, or no data after filter, or user is not permitted any data.
			--|----|---- /root/a/{aId} (..and always without queryParams) - if it returns 404 for missing data, and 403 if user does not have relation with data, then it leaks info about existence of {aId} to the user. So, best is to return 403 or 401 on initial user validation, and then always return 404 either if {aId} does not exist, or {aId} exists but user does not have relation to it - to prevent leakig the existence of data. THIS IS TEH REASON why above it is suggested to just raise 401/403 for the first time, and then never raise it again, and just raise 404
			--|----|---- What about slugs received in process-serializer as part of request body? With same logic, that should always raise 400 error saying that the corresponding slug is not found. Do't say anything about not having permissions, etc.
			--|---- Consider the case of user adding a phone number. The user is verified (i.e. has email and logged via password), but the phone number is not verified. When user gives a phone number, either it is available (i.e. noone else has mentioned it) and user verifies it via 2fa code. BUT.. consider if there's an overlap where someone else has also mentioned same phoen number. Also, 2 more cases - other person has verified it, or other person has not verified it. when the user gives phone number - should they be told that there's a conflict? Correct answer is "No" - here, the user hasn't verified new number as belonging to them, so ideally it should never get any sort of communication back from the service. In essence, we are still expanding the verification domain.. and phone number is still not verified -- so it should not receive any commuication back! Should other people have given same phone number, should we tell them there's a conflict - Yes! - but only if the previous user has a verified phone number. If the previous user also has an unverified phone number, then don't send any message of "conflict". This gives an example of validating in an "exploding data domain" manner to ensure consistent response/sttus is sent so that any information is not leaked by failure.	
			--|---|---- Related: consider a username/password login system. If username does not exist, or username exists but pasword is wrong, then do you show different messages? - or different status. Many actually do.. but realize that this is a wrong thing todo - because this is authentication step and unless it is successful, you don't know who is the one making request. So, regardless of fact that this errors are coming in post message / form, the only error you return is "username not found or wrong password". You never show the difference between 2 cases above. If you are a system that shows a blank user photo on first login or if username not found.. then that's also wrong. Ideally you should be returning any random photo. This is to prevent information leak.
			
			
			
			
	2way: controller + user-auth:
	--|---- For users with a higher level of authorization use a more nested url. For another subset of user with a hierarchical less set of permission, maybe some values become implicit in context and so can be skipped - give them smaller url. One may say to just make url suited to lower hierarchy user and then add filter for higher hierarchy user.. but then, what guarantees that in future an even lower hierarchy won't come. Or, when just making higher-user, maybe you didn't think that a lower order user will come, so the full path REST structure would have looked good. There's also the idea of YAGNI. Why have filter params just with consideration of future low hierarchy user even when though they don't exist now. **EVEN MORE**: I would say that one should think of filter params as only when it is possible to have an array of values that can get passed to queryParam. If you have a queryParam that can always only take 1 value.. then it may be good to instead have it in path. ALSO NOTE: In terms of architecture, queryParams means you are doing filtering - so there is no parent-child relation.. which could be if there is a strong "sibling" relation. That means one cannot nicely form parent-child classifications and so should pull all data in and then filter...and then to enable hierarchical structure - instead have your views/controller logic route from one to other and setting values based on user-role for sub-user, or from query-param for super-user.. as you go from one view to another
	
	
	
	2way: controller + user
	-- consider the example of user login.. they send username and password. For security, this is done via a POST call so that the password is not displayed. Contrast with with the case where you have some user data stored in the database and now you want to do search over email. For this filtering, you use query-param. here's the question: does doing the filtering over a PII field via query-param constitute a leak of PII.. because now people can see the query-param, so it can identify details about user in the system. The answer is no!
	--|---- Why "No": Understand what PII is.. it is an information that user gave about themselves for safe keeping. It is a leak of PII, if the system now sends out PII to someone not deserving. However, when someone does a query, then the email being searched in the query param is not something the the system is leaking out without authorization. Instead, it is a data that is coming in the system. Any user can give any query param to a request (even if the application does not require it) - so having an email in the query param search text is not PII leak. The consequence of his understanding is that: (1) when doing GET list call, always return a status=200, even if no entries were found. Don't give different status, else it is a data leak that a particular email pattern exists or does not exist; (2) When doing GET call for single resource, then DO NOT also give any query param - because now the particular resource can be related one to one with the query param, and that can make a future leak even worse; (3) When doing POST or PUT or PATCH call, then only accept entries from the request body and never use any values coming from query param - because if you do so, then you've created/updated resource using query params, and by doing so, you turned them from being just some value to PII because now they relate to the user data.
	--|---- From above.. note that there is one more way in which data can leak: If a 404 not found is raised for some resource, then that's generally done very quickly compared to returning 200 status that involves extra processing. Also, the response length is less for non-2xx status compared to others. If you really want to cut down this correlation, then add following behavior: for non-2xx status, identify the average and stdev of how slow 2xx status responses are compared to non-2xx status. Then add a random delay rather than returning request quickly. Similarly, when returning 4xx status, add random response headers just to bulk up the response. Same for returning pagination result.. If you are returning less than the page size, then pad with response headers to make the response look of same size. Now, if someone just looks at packet size and time to respond, they'll not be able to infer the status from it. 
	--|----|---- Maybe pick it up in Advanced topic -- specially for time portion. Using together with (a) adding an annotation for avg/stdev of timing defined at controller level, (b) capture the time when request came -- set by a filter in threadlocal.. and the time when exception is raised add extra delay to make the timing seem similar for 2xx vs non-2xx status
	--|---- What if you want to consider something corollary to: general talk is free and open to all, but top secret talk is restricted. Any so, if there is sensitive query involved, you turn it to POST. The answer: If you really want to contain talk, then use separate servers, do data encryption, take care of what gets logged an purge it, etc.
	--|---- Consider a question.. you have 2 RBAC roles: one of them (admin) is allowed to search for all email, other (worker) is allowed to search for email in only a smaller subdomain. How should the application behave if a worker user tries to search for other emails outside the smaller subdomain allowed to them. (1) Don't return a 403: Return 403 ONLY if all paths of that type are disallowed to the user, and not if certain ones are disallowed because they shouldn't be able to access it. This is done to prevent leaking data due to different status -- it's either a straight 403 or mix of 200 and 404. If a processing is being stopped because the user is not allowed to proceed just for that input - then instead return 404 (for GET request), or 400 (for fields inside a POST / PUT request); (2) Other option is to just make a separate endpoint that by definition searches only over the subdomain. Don't give worker users a right to use that endpoint and not the generic one. For this case now.. if the worker still uses generic search endpoint - returning 403 is valid
	--|---- Somehow a related question that doesn't seem related: Should url(s) be designed with hierarchy.. like: GET /parent/{pid}/child/{cid}, or should it always be single depth: like GET /parent/{pid} and GET /child/{cid} (no mention of "pid" here.. not even in query param). Here's the discussion: If a nested path is used, like GET /parent/{pid}/child/{cid}, then, (a) the application will always be burdened to check that "cid" is related to "pid" before returning resource, (b) If {pid} is absent or {cid} is not inside {pid}, then 404 is returned (not a bad thing, but it'll be used..), (c) When doing POST call.. it creates a dichotomy where all other values are read from request body, but {pid} is read from url, (d) We discussed above to never leak PII in url. This is not a PII leak, but its till leaks out that {cid} is related to {pid}. One place where this makes sense is for url design where {cid} is "count" or some enumeration of child within that parent. However, this goes against the idea of having totally independent primary key or slug! Using just a single depth url does the following: (i) does not burden the application with trying to maintain relation between parent and child. Considering that {cid} itself is hard to guess "slug" field, just having one value is good enough. Plus, authentication, authorization, filtering based on user related fields will also be there in application -- those aren't precluded by using single depth url -- and they can still keep out unwanted access, (ii) If {pid} is absent, or there are some rules on whether {pid} should be returned to user that don't allow - then 404 is returned -- so this behavior remains same, (iii) When doing POST call, only the values from request body is read, (iv) The relation between {pid} and {cid} is not leaked. For example, the single depth url can now be used all many places.. and now when, via some other route, {cid} value comes back but is not authorized, then the codebase deals with it!!! The absence of relation also means that BI leak of relation between parent and child entity is not leaked. The url structure becomes flat -- not sure if that's good or bad. One good thing.. the url can be seen as breaking in standard form of "/{root}/{module}/{entityName}/{entityId}"... this is also good from HATEOAS viewpoint
	
	
	
	
	
	-- when dealing with any inputs that relate to user.. don't do a GET call revealing user details in the url, prefer to do a POST instead. For example, commonly, it is known to send username and password during login via POST request.. but what about doing some GET list type of call and filtering by user first name, or last name, or email.. these are PII, and best to not reveal them in url. In such cases too.. do a POST call to send user PII / sensitive data, even if what you want to do is a filtering call that might be more suited via a GET call and query params! CONTINUING ON IT.. if there are related calls/features, then they should also become POST. For example, maybe search should be done with POST because a sensitive data field is-being, or, has-potential-of-being searched over. What about links to different page results.. the call for paged results would also become POST because each call also sends the search field query. DO NOTE that unlike sending pagination data in response header.. DO NOT send page number being queried in request header -- because a change in page number changes the request and totally changes response. So, it should be part of url.. just that the search query should not be part of url.
	
	
	2way controller+dto:
	-- Model serializer vs process serializer. Even process serializer can be model state change (can be via patch) or a big process combining multiple models with child->parent DTO rather than parent->child structure. Also cover general validation requirements
	-- Always return same DTO for POST, PUT, PATCH, GET call
	-- don't return anything after delete
	
	-- Ideally you should have same serializer class for POST, PUT, PATCH call (DELETE may not use serializer because instance data is deleted.. and since data is deleted, there's no use of returning a json, because there isn't any data to populate it!) -- this hooks on eing able to return same json for all calls.. improving ability to bypass using "If-Modified-Since"
	
	2way service+dto
	-- Let's say you are grouping result by column A,B.. The basic ORM will give result as [{col-A, col-B, count-AB},...] list, but let's say you want answer in form of {col-A: [{col-B, count-AB},...], ...} dict - then rather than changing ORM select sttement.. best change the utility that converts from ORM query result to DTO
	
	2way: 
	-- feature flag based service validation
	
	2way dto+controller
	-- for POST return slug after creation
	-- read slug for PUT, PATCH, DELETE from url only and not from request body. Require slug value to match expected behavior (like, a-z,A-Z,0-9,_) is so is needed in business
	
	2way controller+dto (for file)
	Unless you are sure about the file being returned, use Content-disposition:attachment to trigger download rather than opening as html and triggering script runs. 
	
	3way: 
	-- feaure flag + role based validation
	
	3way: exeption-handling + service + dto: If request body is of list type, then, when sending error, send it against the corresponding list index. This allows matching error with corresponding list entry that triggered it. This can either happen at dto level itself when request body is being converted.. or at service validation, or model level validation. Regardless of where/how it happens, if it a 400 level response - a validation error, then format it properly
