	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p id="1606667683">The motivation for this book comes from observation within my own career trajectory that university level coding practices significantly differ from the code architecture expected from software engineers at company. "Productionizing" a code is to incorporate practices, architecture and implementation concerns within codebase, thereby making it suitable for a production deployment <a href="/productionizing/productionizing-productionizing#1607047788" target="_blank">(more on "What is Productionizing")</a>. However, I haven't seen and am not aware of books that cover this topic. Many code-tutoring websites also don't cover such practices and mainly focus on the development of code-writing skills. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> provides many helpful discussions but those aren't collected at single location for easy reference; Nor does the posts cover how different aspects of backend development relate to each other.</p>
	
	<h3>What is covered</h3>
	<p id="1606880433">With "Productionizing Backend Development", I want to emphasize on language-agnostic coding practices that makes it easy to add/modify features in a backend web application. Additionally, this plays well with the Agile methodology of software development. An emphasis is put on writing code that makes it easy to transfer code ownership, enabling other team members to understand, take ownership of, and contribute to the codebase initially written by someone else. In addition to above, it is also emphasized to foster coding practices that bring in other goodies like modularity, reusability, testability and documentation in the codebase. Just to mention again, the suggestion in this book are kept language agnostic.</p>
	<p id="1606880634">I acknowledge that the content in the book can unequivocally be identified as being opinionated. However, all opinions provided in the book are justified by a reason to do so. Whenever possible, I will add external references to support my viewpoint. Alternatives are identified (although, not exhaustively) and it is reasoned why they may not be suitable. If there's a need to develop some code very quickly so that it can be put in production, then these practices can be put on hold temporarily, favoring speed at expense of technical debt which can be fixed at a later time. Finally, I want to acknowledge that the concept of a "good architecture" itself changes based on time, infrastructure and community support. Hopefully, this book can provide guidance for a long term before it becomes obsolete.</p>
	
	<h3>What is not covered</h3>
	<ul id="1606683190">Following limitations are applied to prevent the book from becoming broad and wordy:
		<li>The book won't go into how to write basic codes. There are many good tutorials available to learn Python and Django, or Java and Spring.</li>
		<li>The book won't go into language/framework specific code implementation. Those will be covered in separate book, linking to topics in this book.</li>
		<li>The book will focus on use of REST API for communication with backend. Server-side rendering (like JSP, Django templates) are not covered. REST APIs have become extremely prevelant and cover almost every scenario that one can face.</li>
		<li>The book won't go deepy into SQL, but will cover certain terms that can have gotchas.</li> 
		<li>The book won't cover NoSQL databases. I believe choice between relational vs NoSQL database is an implementation detail suited to product requirements.</li> 
	</ul>
	<p id="1606881647">Last, realize that this book is not meant to rationalize breaking away from your team's coding practices. It is instead intended to identify aspects around which to engage in a discussion with the team to generate consensus to slowly bring about a change in coding practices <a href="/productionizing/productionizing-productionizing#1607047888" target="_blank">(more on forming team consensus)</a></p>
