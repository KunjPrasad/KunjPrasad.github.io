	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p id="1606667683">The motivation for this book comes from observation within my own career trajectory that university level coding and practices significantly differs from code expected from software engineers at company. However, this aspect is not covered in books (unless I'm just unaware of such books). Many code-tutoring websites also don't cover such practices and focus mainly on development of code-writing skills. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a> provides many helpful discussions but those aren't collected at single location, or don't cover how different aspects of backend development relate to each other. With "Productionizing Backend Development", I want to emphasize on coding practices that makes it easy to add/modify features and for other team members to understand, take ownership of, and contribute to the codebase initially written by someone else. Personally, I've noticed that these two requirements are sufficient to foster practices that bring in other goodies like modularity, reusability, testability and documentation in the codebase.</p>
	<h3>What it is not</h3>
	<ul id="1606683190">
		<li id="1606683191">The book won't go into how to write basic codes. There are many good tutorials available to learn Python and Django, or Java and Spring. This is done to prevent the book from becoming too broad and wordy.</li>
		<li id="1606683192">The book won't go deepy into SQL, but will cover certain terms that can have gotchas.</li> 
		<li id="1606683193">The book will focus on use of REST API for communication with backend. Server-side rendering (like JSP, Django templates) are not covered. REST APIs have become extremely prevelant and cover almost every scenario that one can face.</li>
