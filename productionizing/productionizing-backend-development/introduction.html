	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<p id="1606667683">The motivation for this book comes from observation within my own career trajectory that university level coding practices significantly differ from the code architecture expected from software engineers at company. "Productionizing" a code is to incorporate practices, architecture and implementation concerns within codebase, thereby making it suitable for a production deployment <a href="/productionizing/productionizing-productionizing#1607047788" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(more on "What is Productionizing")</a>. However, I haven't seen and am not aware of books that cover this topic. Many code-tutoring websites also don't cover such practices and mainly focus on the development of code-writing skills. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">StackOverflow</a> provides many helpful discussions but those aren't collected at single location for easy reference; Nor does the posts cover how different aspects of backend development relate to each other.</p>
	<p id="1606880634">I acknowledge that the content in the book can unequivocally be identified as being opinionated. However, all opinions provided in the book are justified by a reason to do so. Whenever possible, I have added external references to support my viewpoint. Alternatives are identified (although, not exhaustively) and it is reasoned why they may not be suitable. If there's a need to develop some code very quickly so that it can be put in production, then these practices can be put on hold temporarily, favoring speed at expense of technical debt which can be fixed at a later time. Finally, I want to acknowledge that the concept of a "good architecture" itself changes based on time, infrastructure and community support. Hopefully, this book can provide words of advice and remain useful for a long term before it becomes obsolete. However, it must never be seen as a dictum setting a standard that is aspired to without having any contextual understanding for doing so. This is because in the end, having "A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines" (Reference: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-Reliance" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Self-Reliance</a>), and to prepare a platform where discussions are stifled is something this book does not intend to so.</p>
	
	<h3>What is covered</h3>
	<p id="1606880433">With "Productionizing Backend Development", I want to emphasize on language-agnostic coding practices that makes it easy to add/modify features in a backend web application. Additionally, this plays well with the Agile methodology of software development. An emphasis is put on writing code that makes it easy to transfer code ownership, enabling other team members to understand, take ownership of, and contribute to the codebase initially written by someone else. In addition to above, it is also emphasized to foster coding practices that bring in other goodies like modularity, reusability, testability and documentation in the codebase. Just to mention again, the suggestion in this book are kept language agnostic.</p>
	
	<h3>What is not covered</h3>
	<ul id="1606683190">Following limitations are applied to prevent the book from becoming broad and wordy:
		<li>The book won't go into how to write basic codes. There are many good tutorials available to learn Python and Django, or Java and Spring.
			<ul>
				<li>Python: from <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Python docs</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/python/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3Schools</a>, <a href="https://www.learnpython.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learnpython.org</a></li>
				<li>Django: from <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/intro/tutorial01/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DjangoProject</a>, <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Django/Tutorial_local_library_website" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mozilla</a></li>
				<li>Java: from <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oracle</a>, <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/java/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">W3Schools</a></li>
				<li>Spring: from <a href="https://spring.io/guides" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">spring.io</a>, <a href="https://www.baeldung.com/learn-spring-course" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">baeldung.com</a></li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>The book won't go into language/framework specific code implementation to architecture points discussed in this book. Those will be covered in separate book, linking to topics in this book.</li>
		<li>The book will focus on use of REST API for communication with backend. Server-side rendering (like JSP, Django templates) are not covered. REST APIs have become extremely prevelant and cover almost every scenario that one can face. If working with Java/Spring, use <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring-Boot</a> as a starting point (using <a href="https://start.spring.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spring-Initializr</a> is helpful for doing so). If working with Python/Django, include <a href="https://www.django-rest-framework.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Django-Rest-Framework</a>.</li>
		<li>Databases are an integral part of backend development. However, covering database related topics was getting more involved that initially anticipated. So, that has been moved to a <a href="/productionizing/productionizing-database-schema" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">separate e-book</a> in itself and only referenced in this book wherever necessary.</li> 
	</ul>
	<p id="1606881647">Last, realize that this book is not meant to rationalize breaking away from your team's coding practices. It is instead intended to identify aspects around which to engage in a discussion with the team to generate consensus to slowly bring about a change in coding practices <a href="/productionizing/productionizing-productionizing#1607047888" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">(more on forming team consensus)</a>.</p> 
	
	<h3>How to proceed</h3>
	<ul id="1609170948">
		<li>First things first, know about data structures. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_data_structures" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This Wikipedia article</a> has a good list of data structures. For the programming language you plan to use, know how they are implemented.</li>
		<li>If you are not a web application developer either as part of work or hobby, then start working on REST endpoint development as a side hobby. I would suggest making a Github repo for each project. Add a file, maybe call it "requirements.txt", where you gradually add "small" pieces of requirment that should be available. Don't worry about anything else; the main goal is to get comfortable with writing codes that give some output for request made over the web.</li>
		<li>If you language of choice is Java, at least complete "Effective Java" by "Joshua Bloch" before starting this book (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Java-Joshua-Bloch-ebook/dp/B078H61SCH" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon</a>) because that will be so much more better use of your time.</li>
		<li>If you would prefer to get a broad understanding of software engineering before delving into the specifics of backend development as covered in this book, then I suggest going over the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Software_Engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Engineering wiki book</a>.</li>
		<li>Next, go through the multiple "Glossary" sections of the book (starting <a href="#1608303678" data-nav-id="1608303678">here</a>) and understand each term. Instead of rushing to complete the book, focus on these keywords. Are you comfortable with them, with what they mean, why and how they are used? You don't have to be comfortable with all of the keywords and being comfortable means that you have worked on an example that use the keyword concept. If you are comfortable with less than 80% of the keywords, then take a pause and instead invest time into understanding them and using them in some implementation.</li>
		<li>Time to start this book!!!</li>
		<li>This stage is the long period of time you are going over the book. If you're a developer, you're likely comparing it to your past or present experiences and making notes of agreement, disagreement and improvements. If you recently started coding, you're likley reviewing your past work with new details and making notes, and also trying new coding styles. Awesome! Also, discuss with more people if you feel comfortable in doing so.</li>
		<li>At this stage, you've completed the book. I hope it was helpful!</li>
		<li>Complete the book on <a href="/productionizing/productionizing-database-schema" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">database schema modeling</a>. Deliberate on whether the content in two books complement each other, and if that helps with making a "productionized" software.</li>
		<li>Towards next adventures...
			<ul>
				<li>Look for other "productionizing series" e-book with language specific implementation of concepts discussed in this book, like, using Python/Django, or using Java/Spring.</li>
				<li>Maybe you are now interested in front end portion of web application, now that you've completed the back-end portion. Look for the "productionizing series" e-books covering UX design and UI implementation using some javascript framework.</li>
				<li>If you haven't finished the <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Introduction_to_Software_Engineering" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Software Engineering wiki book</a>, I would suggest going over to it.</li>
				<li>My personal favorite would be to go more meta on the entire idea and to understand what enables a team to delivers production level efforts. This is covered in the <a href="/productionizing/productionizing-productionizing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"Productionizing Productionizing"</a> e-book. It intends to initiate coversations with self and others over how to improve non-technical skills which are equally improtant for growing as a software developer.</li>
