	<h2>Architecture related terms</h2>
	<p>This page lists the various terms that are used in the book and which relate to code architecture. Architecture related terms are purposefully mentioned at the very last to explicitly highlight where one should think of it in hierarchy. These are important terms - not doubt! However, they should not take precedence over the business itself. If choosing between having a feature out fast which is secure and works as intended but does not comply to architecture patterns, versus putting extra time to have a properly designed feature, one should choose the former, incur a technical debt and then try to fix the technical debt subsequently. If your concerns is that the product managers will not allow this to happen, then that's a different discussion altogether.</p>
