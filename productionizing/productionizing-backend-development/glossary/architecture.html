	<h2>Architecture related terms</h2>
	<p>This page lists the various terms that relate to coding principles and the corresponding architecture those principles promote.</p>
	<p>Architecture related terms and corresponding discussions are purposefully mentioned at the very last to explicitly highlight where one should identify its importance in the hierarchy of product development. These are important terms - no doubt; And no doubt indeed because the entire book focuses around architecture discussion! However, realize that these discussions must not take precedence over the business itself. If choosing between having a feature out fast which is secure and works as intended but does not comply to architecture patterns, versus putting extra time to have a properly designed feature, one should choose the former option, and incur a technical debt and then try to fix the technical debt subsequently. This way, the product would have been out for some time. However, if a counter concerns is that the product managers will not subsequently allow time for technical debt to get addressed and will bring in a new product feature to be added, then that's a different discussion altogether.</p>
