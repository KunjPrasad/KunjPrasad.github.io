				<p id="1640273985">In developing and deploying a software application, one comes across multiple concepts / topics  in addition to just "writing codes". Despite the importance of these topics, including them in the main chapters of the book will bloat the content of the book. So, these topics are covered separately within the glossary chapter. The glossary chapter is further divided into multiple sections; The terms that are generally used in similar context are co-located in the corresponding section. Note that the glossary sections only provide minimal information about the topic, and readers are encouraged to search for additional materials on each glosary item and understand them.</p>
