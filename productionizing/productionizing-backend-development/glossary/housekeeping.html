	<h2>Web application housekeeping related terms</h2>
	<p>This page lists the various terms that are used in the book and which relate to web application housekeeping tasks. These are one-off or periodic tasks that don't directly contribute to processing of the current request and forming a response. These may also not be triggered directly by request. Most common use case for such tasks are to either prepare the application for future business processing or clear stale data from past processing.</p>
