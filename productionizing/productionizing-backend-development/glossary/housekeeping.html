	<h2>Web application housekeeping related terms</h2>
	<p>This page lists the various terms that relate to web application housekeeping tasks. These are one-off or regular tasks run as cron jobs that don't directly contribute to processing of the current request and forming a response. However, they may prepare the application for future business processing or clear stale data from past processing, and so, are essential to the application.</p>
	
	<h3>Cron job</h3>
	<p id="1608688160">See article about cron job at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. Cron jobs are periodic tasks that are executed based on a schedule. These can be used to run arbitrary housekeeping tasks on demand or periodically.</p>
	
	<h3>Daemon thread</h3>
	<p id="1608688169">Demon threads, by definitions, are threads that quietly run in background and are automatically closed when the application exits (..not, when a request completes). For this reason, they are can be used to query for tasks in some queue and excute it once the instructions are available. At the other side of the queue, now the application simply needs to keep pushing new tasks into it that need to be asynchornously executed.</p>
	
	<h3>Startup tasks</h3>
	<p id="1608738865">These refer to tasks that must be done when an application starts up. Most common tasks are caching data that are known to not change over time but are read multiple times. If such tasks are set, then do ensure that the overall infrastructure is also set up in a manner that the application does not start receivig incoming request until after the startup tasks are complete. If doing so is difficult to configure, then explore if it is possible to cut down on startup tasks and if those could instead be done at a later time.</p>
	
	<h3>Application Monitoring</h3>
	<p id="1608686638">Application monitoring involves different utilities to understand the state of request processing and related error. This should be differentiated from monitoring the infrastructure hosting the application.</p>
	
	<h4>Audit log or Audit trail</h4>
	<p id="1608738330">See article about audit trail on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Audit_trail" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>. These are collection of changes done to database table entries to prove an evidence of modifications done on a record by corresponding user at some time. Although the Wikipedia article identifies it as a security related task, it is more in line with "compliance" and "dispute resolution"; Security is something that must happen much before the code flow comes to point where an audit entry is made. For a business that is outside of the startup phase, it should also define the time period up to which the audit entries are kept otherwise these entries will keep on increasing in an unbounded manner.</p>
	
	<h4>Logging</h4>
	<p id="1608686649">Generating application logs are one of the best ways to understand the state of request processing. Logs can be made with different logs levels ranging from TRACE to FATAL. See these articles at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2031163/when-to-use-the-different-log-levels" target="_blank">StackOverflow</a>, <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEP7J_10.2.2/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.ug_rtm_wb.10.2.2.doc/c_n30e74.html" target="_blank">IBM</a> and at <a href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSEP7J_10.2.2/com.ibm.swg.ba.cognos.ug_rtm_wb.10.2.2.doc/c_n30e74.html" target="_blank">Medium</a> to understand different log levels and when to use them. Generally, a log entry is made when an error occurs, at which time, the corresponding error stacktrace must also be captured and logged. It is also a common practice to only enable INFO and higher level logging in Production environments to prevenet unnecessary slowdowns and to preent creating multiple logs.</p>
	
	<h4>Distributed tracing</h4>
	<p id="1608687416">See articles about distributed tracing at <a href="https://opentracing.io/docs/overview/what-is-tracing/" target="_blank">Opentracing</a>, <a href="https://www.splunk.com/en_us/data-insider/what-is-distributed-tracing.html" target="_blank">Splunk</a> and <a href="https://lightstep.com/distributed-tracing/" target="_blank">Lightstep</a>. More often than not, modern web applications involve a single request getting processed by multiple components, including different microservices, theird party api and UI calls. Distributed tracing refers to methods of observing a request as it propagates through distributed systems. This reveals how a set of services coordinate to handle individual user requests and is extremely useful to identify cause of request failure or even a slowdown as it moves through distributed systems.</p>
	
	<h3>Data privacy update</h3>
	<p id="1608688467">Moderns data laws like the <a href="https://gdpr.eu/what-is-gdpr/" target="_blank">General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a> and the <a href="https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa" target="_blank">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a> allows, among other things, for a user to get all data that an organization has collected and for that data to be cleared. These procesing are important but they can take a long time to complete. This a good example of a processing that can be done in the background.</p>
	
	<h3>OpenAPI and Swagger</h3>
	<p id="1608689286">REST, being an architecture and not a specification, does not require for there be fixed interfaces and URLs, but instead promoted discovery via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS" target="_blank">HATEOAS</a>. However, this does interfere with a lot of use cases where a client may want to have an advanced knowledge of available REST endpoints which is agreed to be provided as part of a service by the business but without an access to the source code. OpenAPI standardies the format in which this information can be shared. Swagger is a set of open-source tools built around the OpenAPI Specification that can help with the designing, building, documenting and consuming of REST APIs. Thus, for modern web applications exposing service via REST endpoints, it should be seen as almost a requirement to also provide Swagger documents and to keep them up to date.</p>
