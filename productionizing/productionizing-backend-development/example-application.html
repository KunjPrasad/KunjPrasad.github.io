	<h2>Example application</h2>
	<p id="1612649654">Generally, whenever working on some theory, it is helpful to have a real-world business application example at the back of mind to provide a context for the discussions, rather than just disussing abstract terms whose applicability may seem questionable, and whose limitations aren't realized. For this reason, this book will use the example of an "online bank". The requirements for the "online bank" application is further hashed out below - because in a real world setting, that's what a developer would expect from product managers, to give them requirements, so that they can then start developing it. Going one step further, realize that the product requirements will almost always start as being simple and targeted to solve a small business use case, so as to get that product ready and shipped out soon. Later, it expands and/or evolves to cover new use cases. Same pattern is also followed below in describing the requirements.</p>
	
	<h3>Requirements - Part I</h3>
	<ol id="1612650690">
		<li>A bank account will have an account holder, and a balance amount. An account holder will have a username, password and an optional profile photo. The system will auto-create an small icon based on the profile photo. If no profile photo is provided, a default icon is used.</li>
		<li>Account holders can deposit money in the bank account or withdraw money out of it. They cannot withdraw more than balance amount.</li>
		<li>All account holders are given an option to buy additional life insurance at a reduced rate. The insurance is provided by another insurance company.</li>
	</ol>
	
	<h3>Requirements - Part II</h3>
	<ul>Let's say that the work done in Part-I includes:
		<li>Creating table "User", with "username", "password", "profile_photo", "profile_icon", "created_datetime", "last_modified_datetime" columns</li>
		<li>Creating table "BankAccount"</li>
		<li>Creating table "LifeInsurance"</li>
	</ul>
	<ol id="1613439952">
		<li>Each transaction made in the account must be stored. There will only be at most of 1 transaction per day per user</li>
		<li>Account holders can add a customer service message. If the message if of type "OTHER", then a message is needed. If the message is of type "TRANSACTION", then a message along with a reference to the disputed transaction is needed. The details of the official who responded to the message must also be provided. A customer service agent can only see and handle "OTHER" type of messages. Bank officials can see all the messages, and must handle "TRANSACTION" type of messages.</li>
	</ol>
