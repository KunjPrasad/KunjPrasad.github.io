	2way (model+dto)
	since timezone is kept separately in entity, so gather and return it's value separately, or format the time in a particular timezone before returning.. still return timezone
	
	the controller may require returning datetime in a timezone different from what is captured in different data domain. Ex.: the teacher and school are in different timezone but are physically close. Here, school start time is in school timezone, but you want to send alert to teacher in their timezone.
