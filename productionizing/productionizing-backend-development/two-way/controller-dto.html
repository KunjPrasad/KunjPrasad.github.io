	-- Provide a context object to DTO through which controller can provide request related details to DTO -- so DTO doesn't directly query request object. But then, why..? Won't it be simply better to change the initialization of DTO with its validation. This way controller can add specific details to DTO after it is initially made, but before running validations. Maybe add it in 2-way: dto + controller
