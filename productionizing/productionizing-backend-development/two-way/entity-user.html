	2-way (Model-Auth): 
	-- althought it is mentione separately, it should happen almost immediately as part of data model design
	-- Data ownership driven design.
	-- analyze requests with data ownership in mind. Start with data-ownership first design (good example on back forth communication storage, like in chat -- how to make it PII based - helps with take sanitize. Identify which party accesses which data). Ownership should flow down links. So, manyToMany is like a sink for PII and a good boundary between different roles. You must be very clear on ownership and backed by legal if you are going up up from manyToMany back. The conclusion you come to here must also match for corresponding audit log table
	-- PII Take and Sanitize (if you have separate data domain, this is easier)
	-- If getting multiple data by 3rd party api, store them in separate table and then link to it. This allows easier control if data policies change in future
	-- be careful defining authorization for contract based relation: 
			--|---- Say you have a client and worker. When the two are in contract, then the client can see worker relation. But, if the contract is terminated for any reason, then the client shouldn't be able to do so. This means: (1) have a separate endpoint for clinet where worker's data is available. DOn't bundle it with some other endpoint allowing worker access to the data even after contract is over; (2) have a different authorization to acess the data via endpoint - don't just look for client-role on user making the request, but also if the client is allowed data acess for worker slug in path param. ALSO - best do this check as a permission and not within view because (a) this definition, as a permission is more apt, and, (b) view methods must be declarative in nature
			--|---- ALSO, a second design consideration for "time-bound-contract" type behavior is -- never give slug of one party out to another. Think of it like this.. if you enter into a contract with a 3rd party app to get your name, age from Facebook in exchange for taking some quiz.. but instead Facebook also gives it your "id/slug" and now this site becomes the go-to place where other 3rd party give a Facebook-id and get historical data. Then did Facebook do anything wrong? Yes -- **it shouldn't have given out your unique identifier that remains for perpetuity out to a service with which you have a temporary contract**. The better model design is to make a contract table that has foreign key from 3rd party app and from your profile. Now, what goes to 3rd party app is not you id/slug but the slug of contract. If they want your details.. they are given other fields like name, etc.. which can be general and not constrained to be unique. Here, you can control the degree of personalization on data outflow - maybe just give out first name not full name, maybe just the zip code and not exact coordinates. This way, the 3rd party cannot make something tailored to the user of given slug in their code -- which means, things can still get personalized but not individualized (separate topic: unless facebook offers that feature.. but then, its under their control which is still better than letting it out in wild). With the new model, you become "user associated with a contract", rather than "user with that slug.." which gives your application better control rather than have the providers take control.
	-- 5 Ws of PII
Who? What? Why? When? Where?
[When + Where: Should be consistent across all DTOs for org - for same
role] : Governor
---- Privacy depends on country laws, but with privacy becoming
important.. keep it in focus and also to transparently communicate it
to users.. and reflect the same in data model and in table / column
comments



One reason to have one to one table is you want to assign different permissions on the two table! See one-way/entity, 1616835133 -- that's a reason to have separate many-to-many table.



	-- auth+entity(user)
	--|---- Constraining users to have a strong password is something that must be done since beginning of application. strong password via multilingual
	--|---- Salting pwd. Don't ask for sensitive data for login
	--|---- ask sensitive data at most once
	
	(NOTE: below is also covered in repository interaction. In the discussion below, design of DB table is entity interaction.. but actual retrieval is repository interaction)
	--|----|---- Addition to above, in DB, separate out the table, so that the sub-portion that can be accessed by wider role user is a single table and the other restricted role access table is separate, joined to the former via a oneToOne relation.. and defining method preventing object access by other roles. How to define such a method is framework/language specific. This is a valid use case of havig role based security be defined at repository level. This is needed because when the code is running, then the server is one making request to DB to access data.. but it's actually doing it as part of a request triggered by a user. So, we need a mechanism to ensure that the request user is allowed access to a certain DB table. This should also ideally occur for all @OneToOne and @manyToOne ..maybe also for @OneToMany
	-- Sensitive data exposure is a vulnerability. Add extra auditing / controls around sensitive data. Another option is to disallow reads of sensitive data except for admin role:: https://blog.detectify.com/2016/07/01/owasp-top-10-sensitive-data-exposure-6/ -- Maybe move all sensitive data to separate table
