	<h2>Transaction</h2>
	<p id="">Say transaction is an act on how db data is saved. So relates to entity and Repo. But what of others
	Add transaction should be at service level.. and same goes to repo -- so a 2way between service and repo layer
	Don't have it at controller level
	If controller has multiple service calls.. keep each call in a transaction. I have always noticed that generally 1 transaction is sufficeint.
	Keep transaction short
