	Follow up to one-way/entity/1612753728: 2 way model + model: every model across a domain boundary should have a corresponding new table, with one-way or two-way sync between the two. Combine it with "a table in a domain should only reference others from same domain" -- the syncs form legal rules of use. This can however get tedious and that's where legal agreement comes, following which you can squash the 2 forms to one. However, if squashing, be areful about how the 2 will then interplay with a 3rd domain where the "squash" is also getting sync'd. You want to have clear policies. Or, maybe, the other table in different domain is a view of first table.
	--|---- handles pii concerns. Give example of teacher / student / classroom-as-contract; and how last one can cause extra tables that promote security, but based on legal it can be squashed
	--|---- 3 way: model + model + user : is the "LoginAs" or "ViewAs" behavior. If doing so, maybe just having a "View" (and not a table) that does not allow saving data is useful. Can give different authorization for the view
	--|----|---- "data ownership driven design"; domain profile as corollary of "user" in different domains; 3rd party integration should be seen as different user and so if a data is sent out to it, there should be a new table at boundary
	
	
	
	standard data : enum vs new table 
	-- Follow up on one-way/entity/#1615078115: add 2way model+model: standard data + other table: like a single table inheritance, so clean() can get complex - like a delegation -- or, from #1615078115 maybe this should be 2 way model + repo: wherein for single inheritance table same table can be used for store and query. But for multi table inheritance.. only always use the concrete models for storing, but can use the abstract model for query - if wanting to get all entries - even of different type - for same table. The point is:: If the enum values / standard data is just like a simple tag but does not affect any other processing or constraint, then go for single table design.. but if the concrete implementation / validations, etc. can change, then go for multitable design
	-- Follow up on one-way/entity/#1615078115:  If standard data for a row changes, that is not multi table inheritance but a workflow, and Finite state machine considerations come in
	
	
	
	2 way (Model-Model):
	-- make audit entries in same transaction as DB changes. One more reason to prefer a single transaction
	--|---- From cis-20: maintenance, monitoring and analysis of audit log.. run as background service. Additional background service can be running transactional outbox conformance.
	
	-- Model model validation: Finite state machine (FSM), PDA. Mention how this is different from traditional REST design and so it causes friction in implementation
	--|---- Keep model level validation and save() separate --- realize, save() related to repository, but validation related to model
	--|---- Understand why the need for separation -- This istaken from own Django notes but can help here (-- Model.clean() contains validations that apply at model level. Likely, this is the place to add referential checks, or any checks that should hold at DB level but likely isn't getting applied due to limitation of SQL language. On the other hand, Form.clean() is to clean the data that is read in the form from user-request. For example, if your form take a time-in, time-out.. then Form.clean() would contain validation like the date-time is not in future.. but Model.clean() will contain validation like time-in < time-out . Note how Form.clean() is user-data and business-process related, whereas Model.clean() is model-definition related. This also explain why `ModelForm` in Django calls `Model.clean()` in its `self._post_clean()` method, which is run separately after the form's `self.clean_form()` method ..and these are different from form's `full_clean()` which by its name, must do all sort of cleaning.)
	--|---- See #1618602730 in one-way/entity: What happens if sales-rep starts with department of "software", makes a sales-campaign iwth a client in same department, and then "moves over" to different department.. then you have a broken relation. This is because you allowed changing "department" field for sales-rep that was supposed to be constant. Hence, when you're trying to model an inheritance but as single-table, then do not allow the discriminator column to change value. In short, don't let the standard data enum to become process data enum. The enum column that is used with the assumption that it can never change.. must not be allowed to change value. If a change is needed, like in the example, then delete old entry and add new entry. That would raise error due to breaking up of relation.
	--|---- Also see #1618610715 of one-way/entity.. how a "business process" like enum change is modeled like a non business process enum change. maybe everything that is busines process enum change can be modeled as a non-business enum change, i.e. delete old entry, make new one. Depends on use case.. how much of a change happens in what all objects when enum is changed
