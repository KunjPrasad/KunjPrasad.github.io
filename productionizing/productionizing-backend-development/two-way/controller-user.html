	--  (Use id=1619574292) Generally, a nested URL for a "super" role can map to flat URL for lower role. For example, bank admin sees all users, but user only sees their account. However, if doing so, then don't have the nested URL redirect to a flat URL.. because that would confuse the user. Insted, just reuse service method for two controllers pulling the data used by service methods in different ways inside each controller. Generally, service reuse is better than request forwarding in regards to handling of documentation and user permissions!!
