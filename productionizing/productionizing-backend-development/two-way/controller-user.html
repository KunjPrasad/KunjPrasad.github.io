	--  (Use id=1619574292) Generally, a nested URL for a "super" role can map to flat URL for lower role. For example, bank admin sees all users, but user only sees their account. However, if doing so, then don't have the nested URL redirect to a flat URL.. because that would confuse the user. Insted, just reuse service method for two controllers pulling the data used by service methods in different ways inside each controller. Generally, service reuse is better than request forwarding in regards to handling of documentation and user permissions!!
	
	Use id=1624564932 -- as mentioned in one-way/controller, but not given reason, when doing non-GET calls only read data from url path and request body. Never read from query params else it is a security issue -- this related to fact that any url given by someone is captured. Generally slug is the only thing that makes into path param.. also path param values are something that system searches for in DB rather than adding it in DB - so it is not PII that is in system and got leaked, it is just a user input. But query param is susceptible to holding user PII. So if making no GET calls are you read data from query param, then you are leaing PII. This should be contrasted against GET calls where someone can send email in url query param. This is not PII leak because it is a value coming from end user but not to be saved in system. Just because it is coming, it doesn't mean there is a similar entry in system
